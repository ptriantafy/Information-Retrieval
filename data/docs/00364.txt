OBSERVATIONS
ON
THE
BILIARY
SYSTEM
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
BILIARY
TREE
OF
66
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WAS
EXAMINED
BY
CONVENTIONAL
ROENTGENOGRAPHIC
METHODS
FORTYFIVE
PER
CENT
OF
THE
ORAL
CHOLECYSTOGRAMS
WERE
JUDGED
ABNORMAL
BY
OUR
CRITERIA
A
STUDY
WAS
CONSIDERED
ABNORMAL
IF
THERE
WAS
NO
VISUALIZATION
OR
IF
THERE
WAS
VISUALIZATION
OF
A
MICROGALLBLADDER
OR
STRUCTURAL
ABNORMALITY
INCLUDING
MARGINAL
IRREGULARITIES
SEPTATE
GALLBLADDER
OR
CHOLELITHIASIS
INTRAVENOUS
CHOLANGIOGRAPHY
WAS
USED
TO
FURTHER
STUDY
THE
22
PATIENTS
WHO
DID
NOT
VISUALIZE
ON
THE
ORAL
STUDY
AGAIN
ANATOMIC
ABNORMALITIES
WERE
PREVALENT
BUT
SIX
PATIENTS
IN
THIS
GROUP
HAD
NORMAL
APPEARING
GALLBLADDERS
ABDOMINAL
PAIN
A
FREQUENT
SYMPTOM
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WAS
NOT
ASSOCIATED
WITH
ROENTGENOGRAPHIC
ABNORMALITY
NO
CORRELATION
WAS
SEEN
BETWEEN
THE
EXTERNAL
BILIARY
TREE
ABNORMALITIES
AND
MULTIFOCAL
BILIARY
CIRRHOSIS
WHICH
WAS
PRESENT
IN
40
OF
THESE
PATIENTS
FURTHER
NO
CORRELATION
WAS
SEEN
BETWEEN
SERUM
GAMMA
GLUTAMYL
TRANSPEPTIDASE
LEVELS
AND
EITHER
OF
THESE
LESIONS
