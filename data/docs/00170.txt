PLASMA
TOCOPHEROL
IN
INFANTS
AND
CHILDREN
A
STUDY
HAS
BEEN
MADE
OF
PLASMA
TOCOPHEROL
CONCENTRATIONS
IN
NORMAL
CHILDREN
AND
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
INTESTINAL
ABNORMALITIES
A
POSITIVE
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
PLASMA
TOCOPHEROL
AND
AGE
IS
SHOWN
BETWEEN
THE
AGES
OF
4
MONTHS
AND
10
YEARS
MOST
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
OR
COELIAC
DISEASE
WERE
FOUND
TO
HAVE
MARKEDLY
REDUCED
PLASMA
TOCOPHEROL
CONCENTRATIONS
IN
COMPARISON
WITH
THE
NORMAL
CHILDREN
OF
SIMILAR
AGE
