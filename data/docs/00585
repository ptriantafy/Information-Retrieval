INFUSION
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
GLUCAGON
AND
INSULIN
RESPONSES
TO
INTRAVENOUS
ARGININE
WERE
STUDIED
IN
17
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
IN
9
CONTROL
CHILDREN
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
THE
OVERALL
SECRETION
OF
INSULIN
WAS
DIMINISHED
HOWEVER
FOUR
OF
THE
CF
CHILDREN
DID
HAVE
A
NORMAL
OUTPUT
THE
GLUCAGON
RESPONSES
DID
NOT
PARALLEL
THOSE
OF
INSULIN
THE
GLUCAGON
OUTPUT
VARIED
IN
THE
CF
CHILDRENSEVEN
HAD
NORMAL
FOUR
EXCESSIVELY
HIGH
AND
SIX
LOW
OUTPUT
THREE
OF
THE
FOUR
CHILDREN
WITH
EXTREMELY
HIGH
OUTPUT
HAD
MORE
SEVERE
DISEASE
AND
WERE
BELOW
THE
THIRD
CENTILE
ON
THE
WEIGHT
CHART
THESE
FOUR
HAD
A
FASTING
HYPOGLYCAEMIA
AND
ALSO
A
VERY
LOW
GLUCOSE
AND
INSULIN
RESPONSE
WE
HAVE
CONFIRMED
DIMINISHED
INSULIN
SECRETION
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
BUT
DIMINISHED
GLUCAGON
SECRETION
WAS
ONLY
NOTED
WHEN
SOME
INSULIN
SECRETION
WAS
PRESERVED
THE
HIGH
LEVELS
OF
GLUCAGON
SEEN
IN
THE
MOST
INSULIN
DEFICIENT
SUBJECTS
MAY
BE
DERIVED
FROM
EXTRAPANCREATIC
SOURCES
OR
MAY
BE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
STRESS
REACTION
IN
THESE
PATIENTS
WHO
ALSO
HAD
MOST
SEVERE
PULMONARY
INVOLVEMENT
THE
DATA
WOULD
BE
CONSISTENT
WITH
DIMINISHED
GLUCAGON
AND
INSULIN
SECRETION
FROM
THE
PANCREAS
BUT
AS
THE
