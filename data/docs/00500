WHILE
THERE
IS
WIDESPREAD
ACCEPTANCE
THAT
MUCOUS
GLYCOPROTEIN
PRODUCTION
IS
CORRELATED
WITH
THE
PATHOGENESIS
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AS
YET
RELATIVELY
LITTLE
IS
KNOWN
ABOUT
THE
CHEMISTRY
AND
CONTROL
OF
SYNTHESIS
AND
SECRETION
OF
THESE

THIS
PRESENTATION
DESCRIBES
BRIEFLY
THE
CHEMISTRY
AND
BIOSYNTHESIS
OF
GLYCOPROTEINS
IN
GENERAL
BUT
IS
FOCUSED
ON
THE
MUCOUS
