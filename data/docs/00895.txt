MUCINS
IN

CELLS
OF
THE
DUODENUM
JEJUNUM
AND
ILEUM
OF
NEONATES
AND

WITH
CYSTIC

CF
AND
WITHOUT

WERE
MEASURED
BY
SCANNING
MICRODENSITOMETRY
AFTER
ALCIAN
BLUE
STAINING
ACCORDING
TO
THE
PROTOCOL
OF
MCCARTHY
AND
REID
1963
WHICH
CHARACTERISES
FOUR
GROUPS
OF
ACIDIC
MUCINS
IN
CF
INFANTS
OVER
6
MTH
OF
AGE
BUT
NOT
IN
CONTROLS
THERE
WAS
AN
INCREASE
ALONG
THE
GUT
FROM
DUODENUM
TO
ILEUM
OF
BOTH
WEAKLY
ACIDIC
AND
STRONGLY
ACIDIC
SULPHOMUCINS
IN
THE
ILEUM
THE
INCREASE
WAS
IN
TOTAL
MUCINS
FROM
6
MTH
PREVIOUSLY
IN
THE
SAME
CF
PATIENTS
AND
THIS
DIFFERENCE
COULD
BE
ACCOUNTED
FOR
BY
AN
INCREASE
OF
SIALIDASERESISTANT
MUCINS
THE
INCREASE
IN
SULPHOMUCINS
WAS
MORE
MARKED
AT
THE
TIP
THAN
AT
THE
BASE
OF
THE
VILLI
IN
CF
NEONATES
THERE
WAS
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
QUANTITIES
OF
ACIDIC
MUCINS
THE
QUESTION
WHETHER
THE
MUCINS
OF
CF
ARE
CHEMICALLY
ABNORMAL
OR
MERELY
ACCUMULATED
TO
AN
ABNORMAL
EXTENT
IS
PROBABLY
BEST
INVESTIGATED
BY
ANALYSIS
OF
SIALIDASERESISTANT
MUCINS
AND
SULPHOMUCINS
OF
THE
ILEUM
AND
STRONGLY
ACIDIC
SULPHOMUCINS
OF
