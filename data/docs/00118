GLUTATHIONE
REDUCTASE
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WE
HAVE
REPORTED
THAT
REDCELL
GLUTATHIONE
REDUCTASE
GR
ACTIVITY
IS
INCREASED
IN
CYSTICFIBROSIS
CF
PATIENTS
IN
COMPARISON
WITH
AGE
AND
SEX
MATCHED
CONTROLS
WE
HAVE
ALSO
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
SERUMGR
ACTIVITY
IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
GREATER
IN
CF
THAN
IN
CONTROLS
OBLIGATE
HETEROZYGOTES
AND
PATIENTS
WITH
A
VARIETY
OF
RESPIRATORY
AND
IMMUNOLOGICAL
DISEASES
MOREOVER
SERUMGR
FROM
CF
PATIENTS
AND
CARRIERS
RESPONDS
DIFFERENTLY
FROM
CONTROLS
AFTER
STORAGE
OR
INCUBATION
WITH
HEPARIN
WE
HAVE
NOW
EXAMINED
GR
IN
WHITE
BLOODCELLS
WBC
OF
CF
PATIENTS
THE
DAY
AFTER
COLLECTION
OF
SAMPLES
MEAN
WBCGR
ACTIVITY
WAS
SIGNIFICANTLY
LESS
IN
THE
CF
GROUP
THAN
IN
CARRIERS
AND
CONTROLS
NO
DIFFERENCES
IN
GR
ACTIVITY
BETWEEN
THE
GROUPS
WAS
APPARENT
AFTER
4
AND
6
DAYS
WHITECELL
GR
ACTIVITY
APPARENTLY
IS
LOWER
IN
CF
PATIENTS
THAN
IN
CONTROLS
WE
CANNOT
RATIONALISE
THIS
DECREASE
WITH
THE
INCREASED
ACTIVITY
FOUND
IN
CF
RED
CELLS
AND
SERUM
NEVERTHELESS
THE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
CF
AND
CONTROLS
ARE
OF
GREATER
INTEREST
THAN
THE
APPARENT
DIRECTIONAL
CONTRADICTION
THE
BASIS
FOR
QUANTATITIVE
ENZYME
DIFFERENCES
IS
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
DETERMINE
THE
SIMPLEST
EXPLANATION
IS
THAT
THE
INITIAL
WHITECELL
GR
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
CF
PATIENTS
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
AND
CONTROLS
AND
CARRIERS
ON
THE
OTHER
ARE
SECONDARY
TO
SOME
ASPECT
OF
THE
DISEASE
OR
ITS
TREATMENT
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
TO
SUPPORT
SUCH
A
CONCLUSION
THESE
RESULTS
WHICH
REFLECT
ALTERED
BEHAVIOUR
OF
GR
FROM
CF
PATIENTS
SUGGEST
TO
US
THAT
GR
IS
INVOLVED
IN
CF
