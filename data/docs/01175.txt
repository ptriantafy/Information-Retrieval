SULPHATED
GLYCOPROTEINS
IN
THE
PANCREAS
SEVERAL
REPORTS
HAVE
INDICATED
THE
PRESENCE
OF
ABNORMALLY
HIGH
AMOUNTS
OF
SULPHATE
IN
THE
MUCOUS
GLANDS
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
BEARING
THESE
FACTS
IN
MIND
WE
SUSPECTED
THAT
ABNORMAL
OVERSULPHATED
AND
STRONGLY
ANIONIC
GLYCOPROTEINS
MIGHT
BE
INVOLVED
IN
THE
PATHOGENESIS
OF
CF
THE
PRESENT
STUDY
WAS
CARRIED
OUT
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
SULPHATED
BLOODGROUP
SUBSTANCES
OCCUR
IN
NORMAL
PANCREATIC
TISSUE
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
SULPHATE
OVER
THE
EXOCRINE
PART
OF
PANCREAS
DOES
COINCIDE
WITH
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
BLOODGROUP
SUBSTANCE
PREVIOUSLY
OBSERVED
BY
FLUORESCENT
MICROSCOPY
WE
THEREFORE
FIND
IT
VERY
LIKELY
THAT
THE
SULPHATE
AND
BLOODGROUP
SUBSTANCE
ARE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
SAME
GLYCOPROTEIN
MOLECULE
SINCE
BLOODGROUP
SUBSTANCE
HAS
BEEN
DEMONSTRATED
IN
MANY
SECRETIONS
IN
MAN
AND
SINCE
HIGH
AMOUNTS
OF
SULPHATE
HAVE
BEEN
FOUND
IN
THE
MUCOUS
GLANDS
IN
CF
SUCH
A
MECHANISM
IS
POSSIBLE
IN
MANY
LOCATIONS
AND
MAY
THUS
OFFER
AN
EXPLANATION
FOR
THE
MULTIORGAN
INVOLVEMENT
IN
CF
