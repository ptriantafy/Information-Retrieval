INTERACTIONS
OF
PSEUDOMONAS
AERUGINOSA
WITH
IMMUNOGLOBULINS
AND
COMPLEMENT
IN
SPUTUM
THE
INTERACTIONS
OF
PSEUDOMONAS
AERUGINOSA
WITH
HUMORAL
FACTORS
IN
THE
SPUTUM
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WERE
INVESTIGATED
BY
USING
AN
INDIRECT
IMMUNOFLUORESCENT
TECHNIQUE
FLUORESCEIN
CONJUGATED
MONOVALENT
ANTISERUM
SPECIFIC
TO
HEAVY
CHAINS
OF
HUMAN
IMMUNOGLOBULIN
A
IGA
IGG
OR
IGM
AND
TO
COMPLEMENT
C3
WERE
USED
ALL
STRAINS
OF
P
AERUGINOSA
RECOVERED
FROM
THE
SPUTUM
SPECIMENS
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WERE
FOUND
TO
BE
COATED
WITH
ANTIBODIES
OF
IGA
IGG
AND
IGM
CLASSES
AND
WITH
C3
THE
SPECIFICITY
OF
THE
ANTIBODY
COATING
WAS
DETERMINED
THE
FLUORESCENCE
WAS
MOST
INTENSE
WITH
IGA
AND
WAS
FOLLOWED
IN
INTENSITY
BY
IGG
IGM
AND
C3
NO
DIFFERENCE
WAS
NOTED
BETWEEN
ROUGH
AND
MUCOID
STRAINS
OF
P
AERUGINOSA
WHEN
THE
SUBCULTURED
P
AERUGINOSA
WAS
INCUBATED
WITH
THE
SPUTUM
ELUATES
A
SIMILAR
PATTERN
OF
FLUORESCENCE
WAS
DEMONSTRATED
INDICATING
THAT
THESE
HUMORAL
FACTORS
ARE
PRESENT
IN
THE
SPUTUM
AND
THAT
THE
COATING
PROCESS
CAN
TAKE
PLACE
IN
THE
LOWER
RESPIRATORY
TRACT
OF
THE
PATIENTS
BY
SINGLE
RADIAL
IMMUNODIFFUSION
SIGNIFICANT
QUANTITIES
OF
THE
HUMORAL
FACTORS
IN
THE
SPUTUM
ELUATES
WERE
DETECTED
THESE
FINDINGS
SUGGEST
THAT
P
AERUGINOSA
IS
OPSONIZED
IN
SPUTUM
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
