RESULTED
IN

HOWEVER
THE

AFTER
PHYSIOTHERAPY
ALSO
IMPROVED
ON
THE
CONTROL
DAY
WHEN
NO

PERFORMED
THIS
SUGGESTS
THAT
PHYSIOTHERAPY
MAY
BE
EFFECTIVE
IN
REMOVING
SPUTUM
FROM
CENTRAL
LARGE
AIRWAYS
WITH
RESULTANT

ALTHOUGH
THERE
WAS
A

TOWARDS

IN

A
BRONCHODILATOR
BEFORE

MAY
BE
BENEFICIAL
IN
THOSE

DEMONSTRATE

THE

OF

IN
THOSE
