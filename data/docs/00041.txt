PANETH
CELL
METAPLASIA
IS
A
VARIABLE
FEATURE
OF
DIVERSE
DISEASES
OF
THE
COLON
AND
RECTUM
PANETH
CELLS
ARE
NUMEROUS
IN
THE
ATROPHIC
MUCOSA
OF
CHRONIC
ULCERATIVE
COLITIS
IN
SOME
JUVENILE
POLYPS
AND
AROUND
COLLOID
MUCINOUS
CARCINOMAS
MODERATE
NUMBERS
OF
PANETH
CELLS
ARE
FOUND
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
OF
THE
PANCREAS
AMBEIC
COLITIS
AND
IN
VILLOUS
ADENOMAS
PANETH
CELLS
ARE

THIS
STUDY
PANETH
CELL
METAPLASIA
IS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
MUCUS
HYPERSECRETION
AND
MUCIN
DEPOSITS
IT
IS
SUGGESTED
THAT
ONE
FUNCTION
OF
THE
PANETH
CELL
IS
TO
CONTROL
GASTROINTESTINAL
MUCIN
VISCOSITY
