BRONCHIAL
PROVOCATION
TESTS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAVE
A
HIGHER
INCIDENCE
OF
POSITIVE
SKIN
PRICK
TESTS
THAN
NORMAL
THIS
MAY
BE
THE
RESULT

OUR
AIM
WAS
TO
INVESTIGATE
BRONCHIAL
ALLERGY
IN
A
GROUP
OF
CHILDREN
WITH
CF
AND
POSITIVE
SKIN
TESTS
WE
STUDIED
15
CHILDREN
AGED
7
TO
16
YEARS
WITH
MILD
TO
MODERATE
RESPIRATORY
DISEASE
ONLY
1
CHILD
GAVE
A
HISTORY
OF
WHEEZING
NOT
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CHEST
INFECTIONS
AND
THIS
STUDY
SUPPORTS
THE
HYPOTHESIS
THAT
CLINICAL
ASTHMA
IS
A
PRODUCT
OF
BRONCHIAL
ALLERGY
AND
BRONCHOLABILITY
THE
RESPONSES
TO
BRONCHIAL
PROVOCATION
WITH
ASPERGILLUS
SUGGEST
THAT
ALLERGY
TO
THIS
ANTIGEN
MAY
PLAY
A
PART
IN
THE
PATHOGENESIS
OF
LUNG
