RESEARCH
ON
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ADVANCES
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
IN
TWO
AREAS
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
RESEARCH
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF

OF
MEDICINE
FIRST
INVESTIGATIONS
HAVE
IMPROVED
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
NORMAL
MECHANISMS
THAT
UNDERLINE
THE
PRODUCTION
OF
EXOCRINE

THE
AUTHOR
CONCLUDES
THAT
EFFORTS
SHOULD
BE
MADE
TO
SHIFT
EMPHASIS
IN
RESEARCH
FROM
QUALITATIVE
BIOASSAYS
TO
MORE
RELIABLE
