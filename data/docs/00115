FUNCTION
WE
WERE
INTERESTED
IN
PROFESSOR

DESCRIPTION
OF
EARLY
SKIN
WRINKLING
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ALTHOUGH
THIS
PHENOMENON
MAY
WELL
BE
RELATED
TO
OSMOTIC
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
SKIN
AND
WATER
IT
HAS
BEEN
OBSERVED
THAT
SKIN
WRINKLING
AS
SEEN
ON
THE
FINGER
PULP
IS
FULLY
DEPENDENT
ON
AN
INTACT
PERIPHERAL
NERVESUPPLY
THIS
IS
A
USEFUL
SIGN
IN
PERIPHERAL
NERVE
LESIONS
AND
HELPFUL
IN
FOLLOWING
RECOVERY
WHEN
THE
WRINKLING
RETURNS
FURTHERMORE
IT
WAS
OUR
IMPRESSION
THAT
IN
NORMAL
INDIVIDUALS
WRINKLING
WAS
MORE
APPARENT
ON
THE
LEFT
HAND
THAN
ON
THE
RIGHTHANDED
INDIVIDUALS
HOWEVER
IN
A
PRELIMINARY
STUDY
USING
FINGERPRINT
DENSITIES
MEASURED
BY
PHOTOMETRY
NO
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES
WERE
FOUND
BETWEEN
THE
SIDES
