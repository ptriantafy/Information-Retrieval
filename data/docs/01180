TOBRAMYCIN
THERAPY
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
ADVANCED
PULMONARY
DISEASE
THE
AIM
OF
OUR
CLINICAL
STUDY
WAS
TO
FIND
IF
PROLONGED
TOBRAMYCIN
THERAPY
CAN
PREVENT
FURTHER
RAPID
DETERIORATION
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
ELEVEN
COURSES
OF
TREATMENT
WERE
GIVEN
TO
THE
NINE
PATIENTS
EIGHT
OF
THESE
MARKEDLY
IMPROVED
THEIR
PHYSICAL
ACTIVITY
AND
GAINED
WEIGHT
HOWEVER
ONLY
IN
FOUR
OF
THESE
PATIENTS
WAS
CLINICAL
IMPROVEMENT
CORRELATED
WITH
AN
IMPROVED
RADIOGRAM
PSEUDOMONAS
WAS
ERADICATED
FROM
THE
SPUTUM
OF
ONLY
FOUR
PATIENTS
DURING
THERAPY
BUT
REAPPEARED
IN
THREE
OF
THEM
BEFORE
THE
END
OF
THERAPY
CLINICAL
IMPROVEMENT
AND
NEGLIGIBLE
SIDE
EFFECTS
SUGGEST
TREATMENT
OF
EXACERBATING
PYOCYANEUS
BRONCHOPNEUMONIA
WITH
PROLONGED
TOBRAMYCIN
THERAPY
DOSAGE
SHOULD
BE
HIGHER
THAN
5
