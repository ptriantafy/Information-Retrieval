A
PHENOMENON
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
GENETIC
DISEASE
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
IS
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
SERUM
FACTOR
THAT
STOPS
OR
DISCOORDINATES
CILIARY
BEATING
THIS
EFFECT

BEEN
DEMONSTRATED
BY
EXPOSING
FRESHWATER

HOWEVER

THE

IS
NOT
UNDERSTOOD

DO
WE
KNOW
WHY
THERE
MAY
BE
CONSIDERABLE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE

OF

OF

BECAUSE
THE

ASSAY
IS

THERE
IS
A
NEED
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
CILIARY
BEATING
IS
DISTURBED
OR
STOPPED
SINCE
MICROTUBULES
ARE
IMPORTANT
IN
THE
MECHANISM
OF

THEY
COULD
CONCEIVABLY
SHOW

THIS
