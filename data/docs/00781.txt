CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IN
AN
INFANT
PRESENTING
WITH
METABOLIC
ALKALOSIS
WE
RECENTLY
HAD
AN
OPPORTUNITY
TO
STUDY
A
FOURMONTHOLD
BOY
WITH
FAILURE
TO
THRIVE
HYPOCHLOREMIC
METABOLIC
ALKALOSIS
HIGH
SERUM
ALDOSTERONE
VALUES
AND
WHO
WAS
FOUND
TO
HAVE
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAVE
MODERATELY
ELEVATED
PLASMA
RENIN
AND
SECONDARILY
ELEVATED
SERUM
ALDOSTERONE
VALUE
THIS
IS
DUE
TO
CHRONIC
SODIUM
CHLORIDE
LOSS
THROUGH
SWEAT
OUR
PATIENT
HAD
HIGH
SERUM
ALDOSTERONE
VALUES
ASSOCIATED
WITH
ONLY
SLIGHTLY
ELEVATED
SERUM
CORTISOL
VALUE
HIGH
SERUM
ALDOSTERONE
VALUE
INCREASED
FURTHER
DESPITE
CORRECTING
CONDITIONS
WHICH
STIMULATE
ALDOSTERONE
SECRETION
THIS
SUGGESTS
THAT
LONGSTANDING
SALT
DEPLETION
IS
NOT
THE
ONLY
CAUSE
FOR
ABNORMAL
RENINALDOSTERONE
SYSTEM
