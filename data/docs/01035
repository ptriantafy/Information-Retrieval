EVALUATION
OF
THE
FORCED
EXPIRATION
TECHNIQUE
AS
AN
ADJUNCT
TO
POSTURAL
DRAINAGE
IN
TREATMENT
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SIXTEEN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WERE
TREATED
WITH
CONVENTIONAL
PHYSIOTHERAPY
AIDED
BY
AN
ASSISTANT
THE
RESULTS
WERE
COMPARED
WITH
THOSE
PRODUCED
BY
PHYSIOTHERAPY
USING
THE
FORCED
EXPIRATION
TECHNIQUE
CLEARED
MORE
SPUTUM
IN
LESS
TIME
THAN
CONVENTIONAL
PHYSIOTHERAPY
A
SPUTUM
IN
LESS
TIME
THAN
CONVENTIONAL
PHYSIOTHERAPY
A
SECOND
STUDY
SHOWED
THAT
AN
ASSISTANT
DID
NOT
FURTHER
IMPROVE
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
BY
THE
PATIENT
PERFORMING
THE
FORCED
EXPIRATION
TECHNIQUE
HIMSELF
THESE
FINDINGS
MEAN
THAT
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WHO
HAVE
HAD
TO
RELY
ON
THE
HELP
OF
OTHERS
FOR
THEIR
HOME
TREATMENT
MAY
NOW
PERFORM
MORE
EFFECTIVE
TREATMENT
WITHOUT
HELP
THE
FORCED
EXPIRATION
TECHNIQUE
MIGHT
ALSO
BE
HELPFUL
FOR
PATIENTS
WITH
CHRONIC
BRONCHITIS
ASTHMA
OR
BRONCHIECTASIS
