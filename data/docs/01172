TO

THE
PAROTID
GLAND
FUNCTION
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WE
INVESTIGATED
PAROTID
SALIVA
SPECIMENS
OF
18
SUCH
PATIENTS
WE
COMPARED
THE
RESULTS
WITH
A
CONTROL
GROUP
OF
12
HEALTHY
CHILDREN
OF
THE
SAME
AGE

FURTHERMORE
CHILDREN
WITH
BRONCHIAL
ASTHMA
AND
CHRONIC
BRONCHITIS
WERE
EXAMINED
THE
FLOW
RATE
OF
THE
PAROTID
AND
THE
PROTEIN
OUTPUT
WITHOUT
STIMULATION
WERE
NEARLY
THE
SAME
FOR
THE
FOUR
GROUPS
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
THE
PROTEIN
OUTPUT
AFTER
STIMULATION
WAS
SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER
AN
INCREASED
LEVEL
OF
SODIUM
WAS
OBSERVED
IN
THE
STIMULATED
SECRETION
AND
THE
UNSTIMULATED
SALIVA
AS
WELL
IN
CF
CHILDREN
WE
FOUND
A
SIGNIFICANT
HIGHER

OF

IN
BOTH
STIMULATED

UNSTIMULATED

THE

THE
OUTPUT
OF
THE
GLAND
FOR
IGA
AFTER

WAS
OBSERVED
TO
BE
STRONGLY
REDUCED
FOR

FOR

THE

WAS
DEMONSTRATED

THE
INCREASED
SODIUM
CONCENTRATION
IN
PAROTID
SALIVA
MAY
BE
CAUSED
IN
A
SIMILAR
WAY
AS
THE
ELECTROLYTE
ABNORMALITY
OF
SWEAT
IN
CF
PATIENTS
NAMELY
BY
A
DECREASED
NET
REABSORPTION
OF
SODIUM
DUE
TO
THE
RESULT
OF
AN
INCREASED
ELECTROLYTE
OUTPUT
AND
DECREASED
IMMUNOGLOBULIN
OUTPUT
OF
PAROTID

WE
CAN
SUPPOSE
THAT
THE
MOLECULAR
MAGNITUDE
PLAYS
ITS
ROLE
IN
THIS
DISTURBANCE
