STUDIES
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IN
THE
FIRST
5
YEARS
OF
LIFE
LUNG
MECHANICS
WERE
STUDIED
IN
8
INFANTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AT
6
MONTHS
OF
LIFE
AND
RADIOSOTOPIC
LUNG
FUNCTION
WAS
MEASURED
IN
5
OF
THEM
AT
5
YEARS
OF
AGE
THE
CHILDREN
WHO
WERE
INITIALLY
ASYMPTOMATIC
HAD
NORMAL
LUNG
MECHANICS
IN
INFANCY
BUT
THE
2
RESTUDIED
LATER
HAD
ABNORMAL
RADIOISOTOPIC
LUNG
FUNCTION
THE
SYMPTOMATIC
CHILDREN
SHOWED
ABNORMALITIES
IN
INFANCY
AND
MORE
MARKED
CHANGES
LATER
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
LUNGS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ARE
PROBABLY
NORMAL
INITIALLY
AND
THAT
DAMAGE
OCCURS
LATER
EVEN
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
SYMPTOMS
