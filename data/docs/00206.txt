BRONCHIAL
LABILITY
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IT
HAS
ALWAYS
SEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
THE
USE
OF
THE
EXERCISE
LABILITY
INDEX
ELI
DISTORTS
RESULTS
AND
MAY
BE
MISLEADING
BECAUSE
A
FALSELY
HIGH
VALUE
FOR
LABILITY
IS
OBTAINED
WHEN
THE
PEF
AT
REST
IS
LOW
IT
IS
INCORRECT
TO
COMPARE
PERCENTAGE
VALUES
FROM
SUCH
PATIENTS
WITH
PERCENTAGE
VALUES
FROM
THOSE
WITH
FIGURES
AT
REST
WHICH
ARE
NEAR
TO
NORMAL
THE
JONES
LIABILITY

AVOIDS
THIS
DISTORTION
I
DO
NOT
SUGGEST
THAT
A
PROPORTION
OF
CF
PATIENTS
DO
NOT
HAVE
ABNORMAL
LABILITY
BUT
WOULD
MAINTAIN
THAT
THE
ELI
INTRODUCES
INACCURACY
WHICH
MAY
BLUR
THE
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
CF
AND
OTHER
RESPIRATORY
CONDITIONS
AND
MAY
LEAD
TO
THE
POSTULATION
OF
PROBLEMS
CONCERNING
LABILITY
IN
CF
WHICH
DO
NOT
NECESSARILY
EXIST
FAILURE
TO
USE
A
BRONCHODILATOR
AGENT
TO
REINFORCE
BRIEF
EXERCISE
MAY
ALSO
CAUSE
DISTORTION
BUT
IN
THE
OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
