COMPARED
WITH
THE

THE

HAD
SIGNIFICANTLY
IMPAIRED

LEVELS
DURING

INSULIN

WERE
ALSO
SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER
AFTER
INTRAVENOUS
ADMINISTRATION
OF
TOLBUTAMIDE
IN
THE
PATIENTS
WITH

THE
REDUCTION

CONCENTRATION
IN
EACH
GROUP
WAS
NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT
DURING
AN
INTRAVENOUS
INSULIN
TEST
THE
DECREASE
IN
BLOOD
GLUCOSE
CONCENTRATION
WAS
THE
SAME
FOR
BOTH

IN

OF

THE

WAS
AT

IN

A
SIGNIFICANT

ADMINISTERED
INSULIN
WAS
SEEN
ONLY
IN
THE
PATIENTS
WITH

THESE
STUDIES
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
CARBOHYDRATE
INTOLERANCE
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
CONSEQUENT
UPON
AN
IMPAIRED
INSULIN
RESPONSE
TO
GLUCOSE
BUT
THAT
THIS
INSULIN
DEFICIENCY
IS
PARTLY
COMPENSATED
FOR
BY
INCREASED

SENSITIVITY
TO
