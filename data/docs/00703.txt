MANAGEMENT

DISEASE
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
THE
MOST
COMMON
FORM
OF
CHRONIC
PULMONARY
DISEASE
IN
THE
PEDIATRIC
AGE
GROUP
AS
THESE
CHILDREN
SURVIVE
LONGER
WITH
IMPROVED
THERAPY
THE
INCIDENCE
OF
PNEUMOTHORAX
HAS
INCREASED
IN
OUR
PATIENTS
WHO
WERE
MORE
THAN
10
YEARS
OF
AGE
THE
INCIDENCE
OF
PNEUMOTHORAX
WAS
125

WE
HAVE
REVIEWED
THE
RECORDS
OF
22
PATIENTS
WHO
HAVE

44
EPISODES

WE
RECOMMEND
A

FOR
ANY
