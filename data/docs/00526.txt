PAROTID
GLAND
FUNCTION
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
CHILD
CONTROL
SUBJECTS
PAROTID
SALIVA
WAS
COLLECTED
FROM
22
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
AND
21
CONTROL
CHILDREN
STIMULATION
WAS
BY
01
ML
5
CITRIC
ACID
ON
THE
TONGUE
EVERY
15
SEC
OVER
A
PERIOD
OF
10
MIN
AND
SAMPLES
WERE
COLLECTED
FOR
2MIN
INTERVALS
STIMULATED
SALIVA
SHOWED
A
LAG
PERIOD
OF
LOW
AMYLASE
RELEASE
AND
AN
ACTIVATED
PERIOD
OF
HIGHER
AMYLASE
RELEASE
THE
MAJOR
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
CF
AND
CHILD
CONTROL
PAROTID
SALIVA
WAS
IN
THE
ELEVATED
CALCIUM
CONCENTRATIONS
IN
CF
SUBJECTS
FLOW
RATE
AND
AMYLASE
ALTHOUGH
HIGHER
IN
THE
CF
GROUP
WERE
NOT
RAISED
TO
A
STATISTICALLY
SIGNIFICANT
LEVEL
THERE
WERE
HIGHER
MEAN
VALUES
FOR
SODIUM
AND
INORGANIC
PHOSPHATE
IN
CF
CHILDREN
BUT
STATISTICAL
SIGNIFICANCE
WAS
MINIMAL
POTASSIUM
VALUES
WERE
ALMOST
IDENTICAL
IN
CF
AND
CONTROL
SALIVA
IN
THE
ACTIVATED
PAROTID
SALIVA
SAMPLES
OF
BOTH
CONTROL
AND
CF
SUBJECTS
THERE
WERE
POSITIVE
CORRELATIONS
BETWEEN
FLOW
RATE
AND
CALCIUM
FLOW
RATE
AND
SODIUM
ANYLASE
AND
CALCIUM
AND
SODIUM
AND
CALCIUM
AND
NEGATIVE
CORRELATIONS
BETWEEN
SODIUM
AND
POTASSIUM
THE
PAROTID
FUNCTION
TEST
HAS
NO
VALUE
AS
A
DIAGNOSTIC
TEST
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AS
EVEN
CALCIUM
VALUES
SHOW
TOO
MUCH
OVERLAP
WITH
CONTROL
SALIVA
TO
BE
OF
DIAGNOSTIC
WORTH
