EPIDEMIOLOGY
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
A
REVIEW
THREE
MAIN
REASONS
HAVE
BEEN
ADVANCED
FOR
THE
DEGREE
OF
IGNORANCE
AND
CONFUSION
SURROUNDING
EPIDEMIOLOGIC
MEASURES
OF
THE
INCIDENCE
AND
PREVALENCE
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
RELATIVELY
RECENT
RECOGNITION
OF
CF
AS
A
SPECIFIC
DISEASE
ENTITY
WIDE
RANGE
OF
CLINICAL
MANIFESTATIONS
PRESENTATION
AS
A
MULTISYSTEM
DISEASE
AND
GREAT
NATURAL
VARIATION
IN
THE
SEVERITY
OF
INVOLVEMENT
OF
VARIOUS
ORGANS
PAST
DIFFICULTY
IN
ESTABLISHING
A
DIAGNOSIS
BASED
ON
SOUND
LABORATORY
EVIDENCE
THIS
BEING
LARGELY
DUE
TO
THE
LACK
OF
A
SCREENING
TEST
THAT
HAD
GAINED
WIDE
ACCEPTANCE
AMONG
DIAGNOSTICIANS
AND
INACCURACIES
IN
THE
PERFORMANCE
AND
INTERPRETATION
OF
THE
SWEAT
TEST
IN
ADDITION
TO
THESE
FACTORS
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
METHODOLOGICAL
DEFICIENCIES
AND
QUESTIONABLE
ASSUMPTIONS
IN
SEVERAL
OF
THE
PAPERS
THAT
HAVE
HERE
BEEN
REVIEWED
IT
MAY
BE
NOTEWORTHY
THAT
THE
TWO
SETS
OF
AUTHORS
WHOSE
RESEARCH
DESIGN
MOST
CLOSELY
MATCHED
BEING
AIMED
AT
PROVIDING
MULTIPLE
ASCERTAINMENT
OF
CASES
AND
CROSSCHECKS
OF
VALIDITY
HAVE
ARRIVED
AT
NEARLY
THE
SAME
ESTIMATED
INCIDENCE
OF
THIS
PARTICULAR
DISORDER
13700
AND
13800
RESPECTIVELY
THE
ISSUE
OF
SELECTION
AND
DIAGNOSTIC
CRITERIA
IS
ONE
THAT
HAS
IMPORTANT
IMPLICATIONS
FOR
EPIDEMIOLOGIC
STUDIES
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PARTICULARLY
IN
A
DISEASE
LIKE
CF
WHERE
THE
SPECTRUM
OF
CLINICAL
MANIFESTATIONS
AND
SEVERITY
OF
INVOLVEMENT
IS
SO
BROAD
ESTIMATES
OF
INCIDENCE
WILL
VARY
ACCORDING
TO
THE
CRITERIA
BY
WHICH
CASES
ARE
ASCERTAINED
AND
INCLUDED
A
GREATER
DEGREE
OF
UNIFORMITY
IN
STANDARDS
THAN
HAS
BEEN
EMPLOYED
IN
PREVIOUS
STUDIES
IS
NECESSARY
BEFORE
COMPARISONS
CAN
MEANINGFULLY
BE
MADE
THERE
ARE
GOOD
GROUNDS
FOR
REGARDING
MOST
ESTIMATES
OF
CF
INCIDENCE
TO
BE
MINIMUM
CONFIRMED
FIGURES
AND
THIS
IS
PARTICULARLY
SO
WHERE
THE
RESEARCH
DESIGN
ENSURES
THAT
MULTIPLE
ASCERTAINMENTS
OF
THE
SAME
CASE
WILL
BE
IDENTIFIABLE
HIGHER
ESTIMATES
ARE
MADE
WHERE
SEVERAL
SOURCES
OF
ERROR
RESPONDENT
BIAS
GENERALIZATION
OF
HOSPITAL
DATA
TO
THE
WIDER
POPULATION
MULTIPLE
ASCERTAINMENTS
OF
THE
SAME
PATIENT
ARE
NOT
RECOGNISED
