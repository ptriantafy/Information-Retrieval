IS
GIVEN
OF

FOR
THE
EARLY

TODAY
THE
ORGANISATION
OF

EXPERIENCE
IN
PROVISION
OF
THESE
SERVICES
ON
A
NATIONAL
SCALE
HAS
EMPHASISED
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
EVALUATING
FUTURE

BEFORE
THEY
ARE
IMPLEMENTED
BY
RESEARCH
STUDIES
ON
THEIR
EFFECTIVENESS
THEIR
POSSIBLY
HARMFUL
SIDE
EFFECTS
AND
THEIR
COST
EVIDENCE
FROM
RESEARCH
IN
SCREENING
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
DISEASES
IS
VERY
BRIEFLY
SUMMARIZED
AND
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THERE
MAY
BE
SOME
DEVELOPMENT
OF
PROGRAMMES
FOR
THE
EARLY
DETECTION
AND
TREATMENT
OF
HYPERTENSION

OF
BREAST
CANCER

FOR
OTHER

FOR
MULTIPHASIC
