THE
AVERAGE
BLOOD
SEROTONIN
LEVEL
OF
67
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
ABOUT
TWICE
THAT
OF
AGEMATCHED
NORMAL
CHILDREN
THERE
WAS
NO

URINARY
EXCRETION

CHILDREN

ONLY

FURTHER
STUDY
OF
THIS
PHENOMENON
IS
WARRANTED
BECAUSE
A
A
RAISED
BLOOD
SEROTONIN
LEVEL
IS
SUFFICIENTLY
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
TO
EXPLORE
ITS
USE
IN
DIAGNOSIS
AND
B
IT
MAY
HELP
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
