PULMONARY
DEPOSITION
OF
AEROSOLS
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
EFFICIENCY
OF
DELIVERY
OF
AN
AEROSOL
TO
22
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AGED
8
MONTHS
TO
17
YEARS
WAS
INVESTIGATED
WITH
THE
USE
A
STANDARD
ULTRASONIC
NEBULIZER
THE
STUDY
WAS
DESIGNED
TO
SIMULATE
CLINICAL
CONDITIONS
AS
CLOSELY
AS
POSSIBLE
RETENTION
OF
THE
AEROSOL
WAS
MONITORED
WITH
A
SCINTILLATION
CAMERA
INTERFACED
TO
A
SMALL
DIGITAL
COMPUTER
THE
CHILDREN
ALSO
HAD
VENTILATION
STUDIES
WITH
XENON133
WHICH
ALLOWED
COMPARISON
OF
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
AEROSOL
WITH
REGIONAL
VENTILATION
THE
AEROSOL
WAS
VISUALIZED
WITHIN
THE
LUNGS
OF
ALL
22
PATIENTS
BETWEEN
08
AND
65
PER
CENT
OF
THE
INITIAL
ACTIVITY
WAS
DEPOSITED
IN
THE
LUNGS
REPRESENTING
AN
AVERAGE
OF

ML
PER
THERAPY
SESSION
OR
00131
ML
PER
KILOGRAM
OF

THERE
WAS
A
POSITIVE
CORRELATION

BETWEEN
INCREASING

AND
GREATER
PULMONARY
DEPOSITION
OF
THE
AEROSOL
THERE
WAS
DECREASED
AEROSOL
ENTRY
TO
REGIONS
WHICH
WERE
POORLY
VENTILATED
THE
EFFICIENCY
OF
AEROSOL
DEPOSITION
IS
VARIABLE
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
DEPENDING
PRIMARILY
ON
THE
AGE
OF
THE
PATIENT
WHEREAS
ITS
DISTRIBUTION
WITHIN
THEIR
LUNGS
IS
RELATED
TO
REGIONAL
VARIATIONS
IN
THE
SEVERITY
OF
THE
PULMONARY
DISEASE
