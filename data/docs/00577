METHODS
RESULTS
SHOWED
THAT
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
TO
DETECT
PRECIPITATING
ANTIBODY
IN
THE
SPUTUM
AND
THE
RATE
WAS
INCREASED
WHEN
BOTH
METHODS
WERE
USED
A
DISCREPANCY
WAS
NOTED
BETWEEN
THE
DETECTION
RATE
IN
THE
SPUTUM
AND
SERUM
THIS
COMBINED
WITH
THE
LACK
OF
CORRELATION
BETWEEN

AND
SERUM
IMMUNOGLOBULINS
LACK
OF
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
BRONCHIAL
INFLAMMATION
AND
SPUTUM
IMMUNOGLOBULINS
AND
THE
LACK
OF
IGM
IN
THE
SPUTUM
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE

THE
PRESENCE
OF

ANTIBODY
IN
THE

THE
