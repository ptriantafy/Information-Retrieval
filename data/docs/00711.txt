WE
HAVE
STUDIED
SEVEN
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
AND
TEN
NORMAL
CHILDREN
AND
HAVE
CONFIRMED
THE
LOW
LEVELS
OF
EFA
BOTH
IN
PLASMA
AND
IN
REDCELL
MEMBRANE
IN
THE
CF
GROUP
WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
REPORT
HERE
PRELIMINARY
RESULTS
ON
THE
FATTYACID
PATTERN
OF
THE
LECITHIN
FRACTION
OF
BRONCHIAL
MUCUS
IN
THE
SAME
GROUP
OF
PATIENTS
AND
CONTROLS
CONTENT
OF
PALMITIC
ACID
WAS
LOWER
AND
THAT
OF
OLEIC
ACID
WAS
HIGHER
IN
THE
CF
PATIENTS
THAN
IN
NORMAL
CHILDREN
THIS
ABNORMALITY
IN
THE
FATTYACID
COMPOSITION
OF
THE
LECITHIN
OF
THE
MUCUS
COULD
BE
AN
IMPORTANT
FINDING
IN
RELATION

THE
