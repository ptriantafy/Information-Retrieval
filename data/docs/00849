FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SCREENING
IN
THE
NEWBORN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
THE
MOST
FREQUENT
SUBSTANTIALLY
LETHAL
INHERITED
DISEASE
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
NEWBORN
SCREENING
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAS
BEEN
SUGGESTED
BECAUSE
EARLY
DIAGNOSIS
PERMITS
GENETIC
COUNSELLING
OF
PARENTS
AND
IMPROVED
TREATMENT
AND
PROGNOSIS
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
THE
FACT
THAT
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
NEWBORNS
HAVE
ABNORMALLY
HIGH
MECONIUM
ALBUMIN
SEEMS
TO
OFFER
THE
BEST
SCREENING
APPROACH
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
HAD
EQUIVOCAL
AND
FALSE
POSITIVE
RESULTS
WITH
MECONIUM
ALBUMIN
TEST
STRIPS
WE
HAVE
DEVELOPED
A
NEPHELOMETRIC
AUTOMATED
IMMUNOPRECIPITATION
METHOD
FOR
THE
QUANTITATIVE
AND
SPECIFIC
ANALYSIS
OF
MECONIUM
ALBUMIN
ON
A
TOTAL
OF
3895
MECONIUMS
SO

EXAMINED
ELEVEN
ALBUMIN
ELEVATIONS
OF
UNDETERMINED

HAVE
BEEN
DETECTED
NINE
OF
THESE

THERE
HAVE
BEEN
SO

NO
DETECTED
TRUE

AND
NO

THE

IS
IN
AGREEMENT
WITH
PREVIOUSLY
PUBLISHED
RANGES
DETERMINED
USING
MANUAL
IMMUNOCHEMICAL
METHODS
THIS
METHOD
IS
RAPID
AND

THE
QUESTION
OF
SENSITIVITY
SPECIFICITY
AND
PREDICTIVE
VALUE
OF

IS
DISCUSSED
