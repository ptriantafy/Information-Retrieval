CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PRESENT
STATUS
AND
FUTURE
PROSPECTS
IN
DETECTION
OF
PATIENTS
AND
CARRIERS
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
SENSITIVE
EASILY
PERFORMED
RELIABLE
TEST
WOULD
BE
AN
IMPORTANT
ADVANCE
IN
DETECTING
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IMPROVING
GENETIC
COUNSELLING
AND
PROVIDING
EARLY
EFFECTIVE
TREATMENT
THE
SWEAT
CHLORIDE
TEST
WHICH
IS
RELIABLE
IN
DIAGNOSIS
IS
TECHNICALLY
TOO
DIFFICULT
FOR
A
SCREENING
PROGRAM
AND
ONLY
RELIABLY
DETECTS
HOMOZYGOTES
IN
CONTRAST
THE
MECONIUM
TEST
FOR
DETECTING
HOMOZYGOTE
NEWBORNS
IS
SIMPLE
INEXPENSIVE
REASONABLY
SPECIFIC
BUT
ITS
GENERAL
APPLICATION
HAS
YET
TO
BE
EVALUATED
DETECTION
OF
SERUM
COMPONENTS
IS
THE
BASIS
OF
TWO
NEW
TESTS
TO
DISTINGUISH
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
CARRIERS
THE
EFFECT
OF
THESE
SERUM
COMPONENTS
ON
CILIARY
ACTIVITY
IS
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
ONE
TEST
AN
EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT
PROCEDURE
THAT
IS
SUBJECTIVE
AND
LACKS
SUFFICIENT
SPECIFICITY
FOR
ROUTINE
USE
THE
SECOND
TEST
IN
WHICH
SERUM
COMPONENTS
ARE
SEPARATED
BY
ISOELECTRIC
FOCUSING
MAY
PROVIDE
AN
OBJECTIVE
BIOCHEMICAL
MEANS
OF
DETECTING
BOTH
HOMOZYGOTES
AND
HETEROZYGOTES
