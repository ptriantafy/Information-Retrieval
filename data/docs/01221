A
RAPID
PROCEDURE
FOR
THE
LARGE
SCALE
PURIFICATION
OF
ELASTASE
AND
CATHEPSIN
G
FROM
HUMAN
SPUTUM
A
PROCEDURE
IS
DESCRIBED
WHICH
PERMITS
THE
RAPID
ISOLATION
OF
LARGE
AMOUNTS
OF
ELASTASE
AND
CATHEPSIN
G
FROM
PURULENT
SPUTUM
THIS
PROCEDURE
INVOLVES
1
DIGESTION
OF
SPUTUM
WITH
DNASE
2
EXTRACTION
OF
THE
INSOLUBLE
RESIDUE
THAT
REMAINS
WITH
1
M
NACL
PH
8
3
AFFINITY
CHROMATOGRAPHY
ON
SEPHAROSEBOUND
TRASYLOL
AND
4
SEPARATION
OF
THE
TWO
ENZYMES
BY
CHROMATOGRPHY
ON
CMSEPHADEX
STARTING
WITH
500
G
OF
SPUTUM
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
TO
ISOLATE
175
MG
OF
EACH
OF
THESE
TWO
ENZYMES
WITHIN
7
TO
10
DAYS
ACTIVE
SITE
TITRATION
INDICATED
BOTH
ENZYMES
TO
BE
AT
LEAST
97
PURE
DISC
GEL
ELECTROPHORESIS
IN
THE
PRESENCE
AND
ABSENCE
OF
SDS
AND
AMINO
ACID
SEQUENCE
OF
THE
NTERMINAL
REGION
SUPPORT
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
ELASTASE
AND
CATHEPSIN
G
ISOLATED
FROM
SPUTUM
ARE
IDENTICAL
TO
THE
SAME
ENZYMES
ISOLATED
DIRECTLY
FROM
THE
LEUKOCYTES
OF
HUMAN
BLOOD
