IN
THIS

THE
POTENTIAL
PROBLEMS
AND
DISCREPANCIES
IN
CILL
CULTURE
TECHNIQUES
WERE
AVOIDED
BY
ISOLATING
LEUKOCYTES
FROM
THE
PERIPHERAL
BLOOD
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
HEALTHY
HUMAN
VOLUNTEERS
AND
PREPARING
HOMOGENATES
TO
DETERMINE
THE
SPECIFIC
ACTIVITIES
OF
5
LYSOSOMAL
ENZYMES
INVOLVED
IN
THE
DEGRADATION
OF

FOUR

HYDROLASE
WHICH
CLEAVES
THE

BETWEEN
THIS

ASSAYED
WITH

SUBSTRATE
NO
DIFFERENCES
IN
ENZYME
ACTIVITIES
BETWEEN
THE
2
LEUKOCYTE
SOURCES
WERE
OBSERVED
BECAUSE
NO
ENZYME
ACTIVITIES
WERE
DEFICIENT
AND
NO
COMPENSATORY

WERE
NOTED
WE
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
