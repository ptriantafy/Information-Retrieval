SWEAT
FROM
8
RUSTERS

8
CONTROL
PERSONS
WAS
EXAMINED
FOR
ITS

SWEATING
WAS
INDUCED
BY
IONTOPHORESIS
OF
PILOCARPINE
ON
THE
DISTAL
FOREARM
IN
NO
CASE
DID
THE
CONCENTRATIONS
EXCEED
THE
NORMAL
UPPER
LIMIT
FOR
THIS
PROCEDURE
AND
NO
DIFFERENCE
WAS
FOUND
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
GROUPS
IN
THIS
WAY
THE
STUDY
