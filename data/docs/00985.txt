INCREASED
INTRACRANIAL
PRESSURE
IN
INFANTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
LETTER
ALTHOUGH
THE
MECHANISM
PROPOSED
BY
DR
KATZNELSON
FOR
THE
INCREASED
INTRACRANIAL
PRESSURE
OBSERVED
IN
THREE
INFANTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CANNOT
BE
DISCOUNTED
ANOTHER
EXPLANATION
IS
POSSIBLE
IT
HAS
BEEN
REPORTED
PREVIOUSLY
THAT
A
DEFICIENCY
OF
VITAMIN
A
MAY
PREDISPOSE
TO
DEVELOPMENT
OF
INCREASED
INTRACRANIAL
PRESSURE
AND
BULGING
FONTANELLES
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
FINALLY
IT
IS
SOMEWHAT
DIFFICULT
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
SUCH
MARKED
AIRWAY
OBSTRUCTION
WHICH
PRODUCED
INCREASED
INTRACRANIAL
PRESSURE
COULD
OCCUR
WITH
PRESERVATION
OF
ARTERIAL
BLOOD
GASES

VITAMIN
A
AND
CAROTENE
BLOOD
LEVELS
WERE
NOT
DETERMINED
IN
OUR
CASES
AND
THEREFORE
OBVIOUSLY
THIS
POSSIBILITY
CANNOT
BE
EXCLUDED
AT
LEAST
IN
TWO
OF
THE
CASES
DR
TAUSSIGS
SUGGESTION
THAT
THE
IMPROVEMENT
IN
THE
INTRACRANIAL
PRESSURE
IN
OUR
CASES
WAS
REALLY
THE
RESULT
OF
THE
UNKNOWING
ASSOCIATED
ADMINISTRATION
OF
VITAMIN
A
AND
NOT
TO
THE
IMPROVEMENTS
IN
THE
PULMONARY
STATUS
AS
I
PROPOSED
FAILS
TO
NOTE
THE
CLINICAL
OBSERVATION
THAT
THERE
HAD
BEEN
A
RISE
AND
FALL
IN
THE
BULGE
OF
THE
FONTANEL
CONCOMITANTLY
WITH
THE
INCREASE
AND
DECREASE
OF
RESPIRATORY
OBSTRUCTION
SIGNS
AS
TO
THE
QUESTION
OF
THE
SEVERITY
OF
AIRWAY
OBSTRUCTION
THE
CLINICAL
REVERSIBLE
PICTURE
OF
SEVERE
TACHYPNEA
WITH
POOR
AIR
ENTRY
CLEAR
LUNG
FIELDS
ON
XRAY
WITH
OVERDISTENDED
LUNGS
AND
SMALL
HEART
APPEAR
MOST
SUGGESTIVE
OF
AIRWAY
OBSTRUCTION
IN
CF
