SHAPE
AND

OF
MUCOUS
GLANDS
WERE
STUDIED
BY
THE
WHOLEMOUNT
METHOD
AND
COMPARED
WITH
102
NONCYSTICFIBROSIS
POLYPS
THERE
WERE
NO
DIFFERENCES
IN
DENSITY
WHICH
WAS

ARCHITECTURE
AS
WELL
AS
OTHER
HISTOLOGICAL
APPEARANCES
OF
THE
POLYP
WERE
ALSO

THE
PATHOGENESIS
OF
NASAL

IS
DISCUSSED
APPARENTLY
IT
IS
THE
