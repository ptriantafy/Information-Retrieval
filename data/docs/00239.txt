THE
PSYCHOSOCIAL
APPROACH
TO
THE
MEDICAL
MANAGEMENT
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IT
IS
MOST
IMPORTANT
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
FEELINGS
OF
THE
CHILD
AND
HIS
FAMILY
IN
REGARD
TO
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
GENUINE
RECOGNITION
OF
FEELINGS
BY
THE
PEDIATRIC
STAFF
CAN
GO
A
LONG
WAY
TOWARD
REASSURING
FAMILY
MEMBERS
THAT
THEIR
LONGSTANDING
BURDEN
AND
SUFFERING
ARE
BEING
VALIDATED
AND
UNDERSTOOD
WHEN
A
FAMILY
MANIFESTS
EARLY
SIGNS
OF
DIFFICULTY
IN
COPING
WITH
THE
EMOTIONAL
AND
PHYSICAL
STRESS
IMPOSED
BY
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IT
IS
HELPFUL
TO
REFER
THEM
TO
A
CHILD
PSYCHIATRIST
FOR
CONSULTATION
IT
IS
PRIMARILY
THE
FAMILIES
AT
HIGH
RISK
FOR
BREAKDOWN
WHICH
MOST
REQUIRE
EARLY
PREVENTION
AND
INTERVENTION
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
PEDIATRICIAN
AS
THE
PRIMARY
CLINICIAN
IS
CRUCIAL
IT
IS
HE
WHO
MUST
PROVIDE
THE
SUPPORT
AND
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
ARE
INTEGRAL
PARTS
OF
THE
PRIMARY
PREVENTION
OF
EMOTIONAL
DECOMPENSATION
IN
THIS
DISORDER
