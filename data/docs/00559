THE

THE
NATIONAL

ESTIMATED
THAT
THE
PROBABILITY
OF
AN
INDIVIDUAL
WITH
CF
SURVIVING
TO
AGE
20
WAS
APPROXIMATELY
39
ALTHOUGH
MOST
OF
THESE
ADULTS
ARE

CONDUCTED
BY

MEDICAL
CENTER
AND
THE

HAS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
AFFECTED

IN

ARE
MARRIED

THE
REPORTED
FREQUENCIES
OF
THE
CLINICAL
FINDINGS
TEND
TO
UNDERESTIMATE
IN
ALL
INSTANCES
THE
ACTUAL
INCIDENCE
IN
THE
POPULATION
STUDIED
THE
REPORTED
INCIDENCE
OF
CF
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
HAS
BEEN
CONSERVATIVELY
ESTIMATED
AT
12000
LIVE
BIRTHS
IF
ALL
ADULTS
WITH
CLUBBING
INFERTILITY
AND
OTHER
SYMPTOMS
WERE
EVALUATED

THE
TRUE

BE
HIGHER
