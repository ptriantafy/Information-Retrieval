TESTS
MAKING
THE
DIAGNOSIS
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
REQUIRES
CLINICAL
SUSPICION
AND
SWEAT
TESTS
PHYSICIANS
TODAY
ARE
AWARE
OF
THE
MAIN
CLINICAL
FEATURES
OF
PULMONARY
AND
PANCREATIC
INVOLVEMENT
AND
ARE
SUSPECTING
THE
DIAGNOSIS
EARLIER
THAN
IN
PAST
YEARS
THE
ACCURACY
OF
THE
SWEAT
TEST
IS
THE
MOST
CRUCIAL
FACTOR
IN
CONFIRMING
THE
DIAGNOSIS
THE
PRESENT
CASE
ILLUSTRATES
THIS
POINT
THE
MAIN
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
PAPER
IS
TO
SERVE
AS
A
REMINDER
THAT
THE
SWEAT
TEST
IS
OFTEN
LESS
THAN
ACCURATE
AS
FREQUENTLY
PERFORMED
THE
PRINCIPAL
PITFALL
OF
SWEAT
TESTING
AT
PRESENT
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
USE
OF
A
CHLORIDE
ELECTRODE
APPLIED
TO
THE
SKIN
WITHOUT
ASSURANCE
THAT
AN
ADEQUATE
AMOUNT
OF
SWEAT
IS
PRESENT
