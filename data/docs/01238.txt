DETECTION
OF
A
LECTIN
IN
THE
BLOOD
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HOMOZYGOTES
AND
HETEROZYGOTES
WE
THEORIZE
THAT
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
MAY
BE
A
DISEASE
IN
WHICH
A
PLASMA
FACTOR
WITH
LECTINLIKE
ACTIVITY
STIMULATES
MUCUS
SECRETION
CAUSES
PRECIPITATION
OF
MUCUS
GLYCOPROTEINS
AND
INCIDENTALLY
AFFECTS
LYMPHOCYTES
IN
CULTURE
TO
CONFIRM
OUR
THEORY
WE
PLANNED
TO
SEARCH
FOR
ADDITIONAL
LECTINLIKE
ACTIVITIES
IN
CF
SERUM
OUR
EXPERIMENTS
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
LECTINLIKE
SUBSTANCE
IN
CF
BLOOD
REQUIRES
IGM
FOR
ITS
REDBLOODCELLAGGLUTINATION
ACTIVITY
THUS
NO
DIFFERENCE
IN
AGGLUTINATION
TITER
IS
OBSERVED
BETWEEN
CF
HOMOZYGOTES
AND
HETEROZYGOTES
BECAUSE
IGM
IS
THE
LIMITING
FACTOR
AND
IGM
CONCENTRATIONS
DO
NOT
DIFFER
APPRECIABLY
IN
SUCH
SUBJECTS
WE
SUSPECT
THAT
CF
HOMOZYGOTES
HAVE
A
LARGER
POOL
OF
FREE
LECTIN
IN
THEIR
BLOOD
THAN
DO
HETEROZYGOTES
SO
THAT
QUANTITATION
OF
THIS
FREE
LECTIN
POOL
MAY
DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
PHENOTYPES
EXCESS
FREE
LECTIN
MAY
ACCOUNT
FOR
THE
SIGNS
AND
SYMPTOMS
OF
CF
WHEREAS
LESSER
AMOUNTS
MAY
THEORETICALLY
BE
ADVANTAGEOUS
TO
THE
HETEROZYGOTE
