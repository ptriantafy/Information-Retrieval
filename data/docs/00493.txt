CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
CLINICALLY
IDENTIFIED
IN

BY
THE
PATHOGNOMONIC

OF
INCREASED

TWO

OBSERVATIONS
MERIT
MENTION
FIRST
THE
DEMONSTRATION
BY

OF
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
FACTOR
IN
CF
SWEAT
WHICH
INTERFERED
WITH
REABSORPTION
OF
SODIUM
IN
THE
RAT

SECONDLY
IS
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A

OUR

HAVE
BEEN
ORIENTED
TOWARDS
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
A
POSSIBLE

OF

WHICH
WILL
UNITE
ALL
THESE

SECONDLY
TO

A

OUR

THESE

DO
NOT
IMPLY
A
