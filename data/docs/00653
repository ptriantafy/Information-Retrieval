THE

VCG
WAS
CORRELATED
WITH
VARIOUS
INDICES
OF
THE
SEVERITY
OF

THE

THIS
SHOWS
THE
MAJOR
INFLUENCE
OF
PULMONARY
CHANGES
ON
THE
VCG
OF
THOSE
PATIENTS
IN
SEVERAL
SUBGROUPS

THE

ANALYZED
AND

IN
THIS
SMALL

THE
VCG
WAS
A
SPECIFIC
BUT
NOT
VERY
SENSITIVE
METHOD
FOR
PREDICTING
THE
DEGREE
OF
SEVERITY
OF
THE
DISEASE
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
AND
VECTORCARDIOGRAPHY
CAN
BE
CONSIDERED
AS
TWO
COMPLEMENTARY
TECHNIQUES
IN
THE
EVALUATION
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
