DIAGNOSIS
OF
WHEEZING
IN
CHILDREN
REMARKS
BASED
ON
A
POSTGRADUATE
LECTURE
IN
ORDER
TO
DIFFERENTIATE
ASTHMA
FROM
OTHER
DISORDERS
RESEMBLING
IT
ONE
SHOULD
ATTEMPT
TO
DEFINE
CLEARLY
WHAT
WE
MEAN
BY
ASTHMA
AND
WHEEZING
A
MOST
SIMPLISTIC
STATEMENT
WOULD
DEFINE
ASTHMA
AS
A
RECURRING
FORM
OF
DYSPNEA
MARKED
BY
WHEEZING
BREATH
SOUNDS
THE
INCOMPLETENESS
OF
THIS
DEFINITION
IS
APPARENT
ASTHMA
IS
REALLY
A
SYMPTOM
COMPLEX
OF
LABORED
WHEEZING
BREATHING
CHARACTERIZED
BY
HYPERREACTIVITY
OF
THE
BRONCHI
TO
VARIOUS
STIMULI
RESULTING
IN
GENERALIZED
NARROWING
OF
THE
AIRWAYS
VARIABLE
IN
SCOPE
AND
OFTEN
REVERSIBLE
BY
SYMPATHOMIMETICS
THEOPHYLLINE
DERIVATIVES
AND
CORTICOSTEROIDS
A
VARIETY
OF
CONDITIONS
MUST
BE
CONSIDERED
WHEN
STUDYING

THESE
INCLUDE

BRONCHITIS
ACUTE
BRONCHITIS
