A
SIMPLE
AND
RAPID
METHOD
FOR
THE
DIAGNOSIS
OF

IS
DESCRIBED
THE
METHOD
IS
BASED
ON

DIFFERENCE
OF
SPECIFIC
GRAVITY
AND
LIPOPHILIC
PROPERTY
BETWEEN
A
NORMAL
STOOL
AND
THAT
IN
STEATORRHEA
USING
A
BENZENENABR
SYSTEM
THE
STOOL
SAMPLES
ARE
DRIED
PULVERIZED
AND
THEN
INVESTIGATED
STEATORRHEA
IS
DEFINED
EITHER
AS
A

OR

THE
PROCEDURE
DESCRIBED
