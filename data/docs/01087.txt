THE
DIETARY
PROBLEMS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
CARE
OF
CHRONICALLY
SICK
CHILDREN
CAN
BE
CONSIDERED
UNDER
TWO
BROAD
HEADINGS
FIRST
THERE
ARE
THE
PROBLEMS
IN
THOSE
CHILDREN
FOR
WHOM
DIET
IS
AN
ESSENTIAL
PART
OF
THE
TREATMENT
OF
THEIR
CHRONIC
DISORDER
AND
SECOND
THERE
ARE
NUTRITIONAL
COMPLICATIONS
WHICH
MAY
OCCUR
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
CHRONIC
DISEASES
IN
WHICH
DIET
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
SPECIFIC
ROLE
IN
TREATMENT
AND
IS
THUS
OFTEN
NEGLECTED
OR
CONSIDERED
ONLY
AT
A
LATER
STAGE
OF
MANAGEMENT
MANY
OF
THE
PROBLEMS
ARE
OF
COURSE
COMMON
TO
BOTH
SITUATIONS
THIS
PAPER
WILL
REVIEW
BRIEFLY
SOME
OF
THE
DIFFICULTIES
ILLUSTRATING
THESE
WITH
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLES
NO
ATTEMPT
WILL
BE
MADE
TO
DESCRIBE
OR
DISCUSS
THE
TREATMENT
OF
ANY
PARTICULAR
DISORDER
