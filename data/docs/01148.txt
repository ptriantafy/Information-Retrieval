HAS
PUBLISHED
A
HYPOTHESIS
RELATING
TO
THE
PRIMARY
CAUSE
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
BASED
ON
HIS
OBSERVATIONS
THAT
THE
LEVEL
OF
ALKALINE
PHOSPHATASE
ALP
IN
CFDERIVED
SKIN
FIBROBLASTS
BUT
NOT
FIBROBLASTS
DERIVED
FROM
NORMAL
INDIVIDUALS
COULD
BE
INCREASED
SEVERALFOLD
BY
GROWING
THE
CELLS

THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE

WE
HAVE
NOT
BEEN

ANY

UNDER
WHAT

TO

IDENTICAL

TO
THOSE

BY

IT
THUS
APPEARS
THAT
UNDER
THE
CONDITIONS
CURRENTLY
EMPLOYED
IN
OUR
LABORATORY
THERE
IS
NO
DIAGNOSTIC
DISCRIMINATION
BETWEEN
