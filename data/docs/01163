THE
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
GENE
IGE
AND
IGG4
WE
DECIDED
TO
SURVEY
A
GEOGRAPHICALLY
DEFINED
POPULATION
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
AND
PARENTS
LIVING
IN
AVON
COUNTY
ENGLAND
BY
EXAMINING
THE
OBLIGATE
HETEROZYGOTES
THE
PARENTS
WE
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
ASSESS
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
THE
CF
GENE
WITHOUT
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
DISEASE
THERE
IS
AN
INCREASE
IN
IMMEDIATE
HYPERSENSITIVITY
TO
A
FUMIGATUS
IN
CF
PATIENTS
BUT
NOT
THEIR
PARENTS
THIS
INCREASED
SENSITIVITY
IS
PROBABLY
IGEMEDIATED
AND
A
SECONDARY
EFFECT
OF
LUNG
DAMAGE
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
CF
GENE
PRODUCES
A
GENERALISED
INCREASE
IN
SKIN
REACTIVITY
ATOPY
SERUM
IGE
OR
SERUM
IGG4
IN
THE
HETEROZYGOTES
THEY
ARE
NOT
THEREFORE
LIKELY
TO
DEVELOP
ASTHMA
