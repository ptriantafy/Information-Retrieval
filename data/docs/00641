INTRACTABLE
DIARRHOEA
OF
INFANCY
THE
INTRACTABLE
DIARRHOEA
SYNDROME
OF
INFANCY
CONTINUES
TO
BE
A
MAJOR
DIAGNOSTIC
AND
THERAPEUTIC
CHALLENGE
TO
THE
PAEDIATRICIAN
AND
PAEDIATRIC
GASTROENTEROLOGIST
A
CAREFULLY
ORGANIZED
STAGED
APPROACH
TO
DIAGNOSIS
WILL
PROVIDE
THE
BEST
METHOD
OF
IDENTIFYING
THOSE
INFANTS
IN
WHOM
A
SPECIFIC
AETIOLOGY
EXISTS
AND
FOR
WHOM
SPECIFIC
THERAPY
IS
OFTEN
AVAILABLE
REGARDLESS
OF
AETIOLOGY
HOWEVER
THE
EARLY
USE
OF
APPROPRIATE
NUTRITIONAL
SUPPORT
WILL
NOT
ONLY
REDUCE
MORBIDITY
AND
MORTALITY
IN
THESE
INFANTS
BUT
WILL
PREVENT
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
MANY
OF
THE
SECONDARY
CONSEQUENCES
OF
MALNUTRITION
THE
PHYSICIAN
MUST
COMPULSIVELY
PAY
ATTENTION
TO
THE
DETAILS
OF
DAILY
MANAGEMENT
AND
PROVIDE
AN
ORGANIZED
APPROACH
TO
DIAGNOSIS
AND
TREATMENT
IN
ORDER
TO
IMPROVE
THE
OUTCOME
OF
INFANTS
WITH
INTRACTABLE
DIARRHOEA
