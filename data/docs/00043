MORE

WERE
EXAMINED
IN
A
STUDY
CARRIED
OUT
BETWEEN
AUGUST
1972
AND
FEBRUARY

THE
SOCIAL
AND
EMOTIONAL

THE
PATIENTS
AND
MOTHERS
ARE
REPORTED
ON
AT
ALL
AGES
SOCIALLY
EMBARRASSING
SYMPTOMS
AND
AWARENESS
OF
BEING
DIFFERENT
CREATE
MAJOR
PROBLEMS
FOR
THE
PATIENT
THE
UNCERTAINTY
OF
PROGNOSIS
AND
DOUBTS
ABOUT
THE
PROSPECTS
OF
EMPLOYMENT
ARE
SPECIALLY
RELEVANT
FOR
THE
TEENAGER
IT
IS
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
PATIENT
BE
GIVEN
AMPLE
OPPORTUNITY
FROM
EARLY
ADOLESCENCE
ONWARD
TO
DISCUSS
ALL

PROBLEMS
SUCH
AS
DEPRESSION
FEELINGS

PHYSICAL
DEMANDS
OF
CONSTANT
TREATMENT
WHICH
THE
PARENTS
OF
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
EXPERIENCE
ARE
PROBABLY
SIMILAR
TO
THOSE
CONFRONTING
PARENTS
OF
OTHER
CHRONICALLY
ILL
AND
HANDICAPPED
CHILDREN
BUT
SPECIAL
DIFFICULTIES
STEM
FROM
THE
GENETIC
BASIS
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
FROM
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
AN
EVENTUALLY
FATAL
OUTCOME
THE
ROLES
OF
PROFESSIONAL
MEMBERS
OF
THE
MEDICAL
TEAM
ARE
TOUCHED
ON
PARTICULARLY
IN
RELATION
TO
GENETIC
COUNSELING
AND
THE

AND
EMOTIONAL
SUPPORT
TO

COMMENTS
ARE
MADE
ON
THE

THE
