ELEVATED
LEVELS
OF
PLASMA
CEA
WERE
FOUND
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
ELEVATIONS
WERE
WELL
CORRELATED
WITH
THE
SHWACHMAN

PARALLEL
CHANGES
OF
THE
LEVELS
OF
PLASMA
CEA
AND
CLINICAL
CONDITIONS
OF
FOUR
PATIENTS
WERE
ALSO
OBSERVED
IN
THE
FOLLOWUP
STUDIES
CLOSE
CLINICAL
EXAMINATION
INDICATED
THAT
THE
ELEVATED
PLASMA
CEA
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
MAY
BE
DERIVED
FROM
SPUTUM
WHICH
IS
PRODUCED
IN
ABNORMAL
AMOUNTS
THIS
HYPOTHESIS
IS
FURTHER
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
VERY
HIGH
CONTENT
AND
THE
CHROMATOGRAPHIC
PROFILE
OF
