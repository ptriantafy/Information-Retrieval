MEASUREMENT
OF
CHLORIDE
IN
SWEAT
WITH
THE
CHLORIDESELECTIVE
ELECTRODE
WE
DESCRIBE
HERE
AN
IMPROVED
METHOD
FOR
THE
SWEAT
TEST
WITH
THE
CHLORIDESELECTIVE
ELECTRODE
AFTER
SWEAT
PRODUCTION
IS
STIMULATED
WITH
PILOCARPINE
WHICH
GIVES
RESULTS
COMPARABLE
TO
THE
MORE
TEDIOUS
PROCEDURE
OF
GIBSON
AND
COOKE
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SHOULD
NEVER
BE
DIAGNOSED
SOLELY
ON
THE
RESULTS
OF
ANY
KIND
OF
SWEAT
TEST
THE
DIAGNOSIS
MUST
BE
CONSISTENT
WITH
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
HISTORY
AND
OTHER
STUDIES
INCLUDING
A
REPEAT
OF
THE
TWO
SWEAT
TESTS
AT
ANOTHER
TIME
ONLY
BY
CLINICAL
EXAMINATION
AND
REPEATED
SWEAT
TESTS
CAN
A
PHYSICIAN
CONFIRM
OR
RULE
OUT
THIS
DIAGNOSIS
