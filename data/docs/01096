FIBROSIS
CF
OR
TO
MAKE
A
PRENATAL
DIAGNOSIS
OF
CF
HAVE
BEEN
UNSUCCESSFUL
ONE
APPROACH
TO
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
TO
LOOK
FOR
ASSOCIATIONS
BETWEEN
KNOWN
GENETIC
MARKERS
AND
THE
LOCUS
FOR
CF
IN
GENERAL
THESE
STUDIES
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
THE
FREQUENCY
OF
HLA
TYPES
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
AND
HAVE
FAILED
TO
DEMONSTRATE
A
STRONG
ASSOCIATION
WE
ATTEMPTED
TO
LOOK
FOR
LINKAGE
BETWEEN
HLA
HAPLOTYPES
AND
CF
IN
FAMILIES
WITH
MORE
THAN
ONE
AFFECTED
MEMBER
THE
SEGREGATION
OF
HLA
IN
THESE
AFFECTED
SIBPAIRS
VARY
LITTLE
FROM
THE
EXPECTED
ALTHOUGH
THE
SAMPLE
SIZE
IS
SMALL
IT
IS
UNLIKELY
THAT
A
CLOSE
LINKAGE
EXISTS
BETWEEN
THE
HLA
LOCI
AND
THE
CF
LOCUS
