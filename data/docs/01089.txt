PRODUCING
A

THE
MOST
USEFUL
ARE
GENTAMICIN
TOBRAMYCIN
SISOMICIN

INDICATED
IN

CARBENICILLIN
TICARCILLIN
CARFENICILLIN

AZOCILLIN
SHOULD
NEVER
BE
GIVEN

POLYVALENT
VACCINES
SHOULD
BE

IT
IS
NOW

THAT
IN

CAUSED
BY
MUCOUS

MOST
FREQUENTLY
ENCOUNTERED
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
