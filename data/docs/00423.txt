CHOLESTASIS
IN
INFANCY
STATUS
REPORT
AND
CONCEPTUAL
APPROACH
THIS
REVIEW
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
DISTURBANCES
IN
BILE
FLOW
THAT
OCCUR
EARLY
IN
LIFE
ALTHOUGH
CHOLESTASIS
IS
DEFINED
PHYSIOLOGICALLY
IT
CAN
BE
CONSIDERED
TO
HAVE
MORPHOLOGICAL
FEATURES
MORPHOLOGICAL
CHOLESTASIS
IS
THE
PRESENCE
OF
BILE
PIGMENTS
IN
HISTOPATHOLOGICAL
SECTIONS
OF
THE
LIVER
AND
IS
MOST
EASILY
RECOGNIZED
AS
BILE
PLUGS
OR
THROMBI
IN
BILE
CANALICULI
PHYSIOLOGICAL
CHOLESTASIS
A
REDUCTION
IN
BILE
FLOW
IS
INFERRED
FROM
THE
FINDING
OF
AN
ELEVATED
SERUM
BILE
ACID
THIS
INFERENCE
IS
DERIVED
FROM
THE
KNOWN
POSITIVE
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
CANALICULAR
BILE
FLOW
AND
BILE
ACID
EXCRETION
THAT
HAS
BEEN
FOUND
TO
OCCUR
IN
ALL
SPECIES
THIS
FAR
EXAMINED
INCLUDING
MAN
AN
INCREASE
IN
THE
AMOUNT
OF
BILE
ACID
IN
PLASMA
IMPLIES
A
REDUCTION
IN
THE
HEPATIC
TRANSPORT
OF
THE
PRIMARY
CONJUGATED
BILE
ACIDS
OF
MAN
AND
THEREFORE
A
DECREASE
IN
ASSOCIATED
CANALICULAR
BILE
FLOW
CLASSIFICATIONS
OF
CHOLESTATIC
SYNDROMES
FUNCTIONAL
ABNORMALITIES
AND
THERAPY
FOR
CHOLESTASIS
SYNDROMES
ARE
DISCUSSED
