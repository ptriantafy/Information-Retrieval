BRONCHIAL
REACTIVITY
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THERE
IS
CONSIDERABLE
DISPUTE
REGARDING
THE
PREVALENCE
OF
ASTHMA
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
WE
STUDIED
50
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
AND
COMPARED
THEIR
RESPONSIVENESS
TO
INHALED
HISTAMINE
WITH
THAT
OF
ASTHMATIC
CHILDREN
THE
INCIDENCE
OF
POSITIVE
RESPONSES
TO
INHALED
HISTAMINE
WAS
24
IN
THE
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
AND
MORE
THAN
90
IN
THE
ASTHMATIC
PATIENTS
WE
FOUND
NO
CORRELATION
IN
THE
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
BETWEEN
THE
HISTAMINE
RESPONSE
AND
SEVERAL
INDEXES
OF
ATOPY
CLINICAL
ALLERGIC
DISEASE
AND
POSITIVE
ALLERGEN
SKIN
TESTS
POSITIVE
RESPONDERS
TO
HISTAMINE
WERE
NOT
EVENLY
DISTRIBUTED
OVER
THE
DISEASE
SPECTRUM
OF
CF
INSTEAD
POSITIVE
RESPONSES
OCCURRED
ONLY
IN
THOSE
PATIENTS
WHOSE
PRECHALLENGE
PULMONARY
FUNCTION
WAS
ABNORMAL
WE
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
HEIGHTENED
BRONCHIAL
REACTIVITY
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
REFLECTS
THE
SEVERITY
OF
THEIR
UNDERLYING
LUNG
DISEASE
RATHER
THAN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
COEXISTENT
ASTHMA
