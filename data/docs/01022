CHILDREN
NEED
HELP
TOO
THE
CONTROL
OF
SYMPTOMS
IN
DYING
CHILDREN
IS
OFTEN
SADLY
NEGLECTED
THIS
NEGLECT
IS
REFLECTED
IN
A
REVIEW
OF
THE
CASE
NOTES
OF
TWO
CHILDREN
WHO
DIED
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WITHIN
THREE
YEARS
OF
EACH
OTHER
THE
GIRLS
WERE
UNDER
THE
CARE
OF
THE
SAME
CONSULTANT
WHO
IN
THE
INTERVAL
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
CASES
WAS
INTRODUCED
TO
THE
CONCERN
OF
PROPER
TERMINAL
CARE
FOR
CHILDREN
