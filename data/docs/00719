THE
COLLECTION
OF
SPECIMENS
THE
EARLY
DIAGNOSIS
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
EXTREMELY
URGENT
SINCE
THE
DISEASE
IS
TREATABLE
THE
STANDARD
TEST
IS
THE

ELEVATION
OF
SODIUM
AND
CHLORIDE
IN
THE

THREE
TESTS
ARE
USED

ASSESS
PANCREATIC
FUNCTION
FIRST
IS
THE
MEASUREMENT
OF
STOOL
TRYPSIN
AND
CHYMOTRYPSIN
SECOND
STIMULATION
WITH
HORMONES

THE

AN
EVERGROWING
NUMBER

LATE
CHILDHOOD

INSUFFICIENCY
IN
CHILDHOOD
IS

THE
INCIDENCE
OF
THIS

IS
APPROXIMATELY
ONE
PER
1000
LIVE

OCCURS
IN
ALL

AND
THE
DEFECT
IS
TRANSMITTED
AS

FEATURES
ARE
FREQUENT
BOWEL
MOVEMENTS
WITH
