COMPARED
THE

COMPARED
THE

OUR
OBSERVATIONS
PROVIDE
AN
ENTIRELY
NEW
INTERPRETATION
FOR
THE
APPARENT
CHANGES
OCCURRING
IN
LYMPHOCYTIC
ENZYMES
DURING
CULTURE
OF
LYMPHOCYTES
WITH
MITOGENS
AND
SUGGEST
THAT
A
SERUM
FACTOR
IS
PRESENT
IN

THAT
MIMICS

WHEN

THIS
APPEARS
TO

FROM
A

THIS
PHENOMENON
IS
USEFUL
FOR
