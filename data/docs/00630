LUNG
LAVAGE
IN
PATIENTS
WITH

FIBROSIS
ONE
HUNDRED
FIFTYTHREE
LUNG
LAVAGE
PROCEDURES
WERE
PERFORMED
ON
81
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
DURING
THE
YEARS
1963
TO
1976
LOCAL
ANALGESIA
WAS
USED
IN
24
LAVAGES
DONE
VIA
A
RIGID
BRONCHOSCOPE
AND
IN
A
GROUP
OF
73
LAVAGES
DIRECTED
BY
A
FIBEROPTIC
BRONCHOSCOPE
NO
ABNORMALITIES
IN
CARDIAC
RATE
OR
RHYTHM
WERE
OBSERVED
WITH
THE
LAVAGES
DIRECTED
BY
FIBEROPTIC
BRONCHOSCOPE
FIFTYSIX
LAVAGES
WERE
PERFORMED
UNDER
GENERAL
ANESTHESIA
WITH
20
CARDIAC
ABNORMALITIES
BEING
NOTED
AMONG
THIS
GROUP
SUBJECTIVE
IMPROVEMENT
WAS
NOTED
IN
96
OF
THE
56
PATIENTS
WHO
HAD
LAVAGE
UNDER
GENERAL
ANESTHESIA
OBJECTIVE
IMPROVEMENT
WAS
APPARENT
IN
45
OF
THE
24
PATIENTS
WHO
HAD
LAVAGE
WITH
THE
RIGID
BRONCHOSCOPE
AND
64
OF
THE
36
PATIENTS
WHO
HAD
LAVAGE
BY
FIBEROPTIC
BRONCHOSCOPY
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
OF
VARYING
STAGES
OF
DISABILITY
CAN
MORE
SAFETY
AND
WITH
GOOD
IMPROVEMENT
HAVE
BRONCHIAL
WASHOUTS
WITH
THE
FIBEROPTIC
BRONCHOSCOPE
THAN
WITH
EITHER
OF
THE
OTHER
TWO
TECHNIQUES
