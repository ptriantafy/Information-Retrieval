FIFTY
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
PATIENTS
OF
WHOM
9
HAD
MULTILOBULAR
CIRRHOSIS
WERE
OBSERVED
REGULARLY
FOR
A
PERIOD
OF
3
YEARS
AND
VARIOUS
LIVER
FUNCTION
TESTS
INDICATING
CYTOLYSIS
CHOLESTASIS
AND
CELLULAR
INSUFFICIENCY
WERE
PERFORMED
IMMUNOGLOBULIN
AND
PROTHROMBIN
WERE
ASSAYED
IN
9
PATIENTS
WITH
CIRRHOSIS
THE
TESTS
WERE
GENERALLY
ABNORMAL
TWO
DISTINCT
BIOCHEMICAL
PATTERNS
OF
CIRRHOSIS
WERE
DISTINGUISHED
ONE
CLEARLY
CHOLESTATIC
AND
THE
OTHER
OF
A
MORE
CELLULAR
TYPE
THE
DISTINCTION
WAS
MADE
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
IGA

TRANSFERRIN
RATIO
AND
OF
GAMMAGLUTAMYLTRANSPEPTIDASE
LEVELS
IN
THE
NONCIRRHOTIC
PATIENTS
A
TEMPORARY
INCREASE
OF
CYTOLYSIS
AND
CHOLESTASIS
WAS
OBSERVED
IN
50
OF
THE
CASES
