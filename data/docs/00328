GENETICS
AND
INCIDENCE
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
A
GENETICALLY
DETERMINED
DISORDER
THE
EVIDENCE
THAT
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
INHERITED
IN
THIS
WAY
COMES
FROM
SEVERAL
SOURCES
THE
BIRTH
FREQUENCY
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
UNEXPECTEDLY
HIGH
IN
BRITAIN
FOR
SUCH
A
SERIOUS
ILLNESS
IT
IS
EASY
TO
CALCULATE
THE
PROPORTION
OF
THE
POPULATION
WHO
ARE
CARRIERS
FROM
THE
BIRTH
FREQUENCY
OF
THE
DISEASE
THE
EXPLANATION
OF
THE
UNLIKELY
HIGH
BIRTH
FREQUENCY
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IN
EUROPE
IS
NOT
KNOWN
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
REDUCE
SUBSTANTIALLY
THE
BIRTH
FREQUENCY
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WILL
BECOME
POSSIBLE
ONCE
IT
IS
PRACTICABLE
TO
DETECT
RELIABLY
THE
CARRIER
OF
THE
GENE
