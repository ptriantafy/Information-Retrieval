THIS
STUDY
WAS
UNDERTAKEN
BECAUSE
OF
REPORTS
OF
A
MARKED
INCREASE
IN
FECAL
BILE
ACID
EXCRETION
BY
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WE
ATTEMPTED
TO
CONFIRM
THIS
FINDING
BY
PERFORMING
114CCHOLYLGLYCINE
BREATH
TESTS
AND
BY
MEASURING
FECAL
BILE
ACID
AND
FAT
EXCRETION
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
ACQUIRED
PANCREATIC

STUDIES
WERE
DONE
WHEN
PATIENTS
WERE
TAKING
PANCREATIC
ENZYMES
COTAZYM
AND
ALSO
WITHOUT
MEDICATION
14CO2
EXCRETION
IN
BREATH
WAS
NORMAL
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
ACQUIRED
PANCREATIC
INSUFFICIENCY
AND
EVEN
LOWER
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
BOTH
WITH
AND
WITHOUT
COTAZYM
THERAPY
FECAL
BILE
ACID
EXCRETION
WAS
SLIGHTLY
ELEVATED
IN
BOTH
GROUPS
WITHOUT
COTAZYM
AND
BECAME
NORMAL
WITH
COTAZYM
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
ACQUIRED

STEATORRHEA
WAS
PRESENT
IN
BOTH
PATIENT
GROUPS

IMPROVED
DURING

THERAPY
BILE
ACID
MALABSORPTION
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
ACQUIRED
PANCREATIC
INSUFFICIENCY
IS
MINIMAL
AND
PROBABLY
NOT
CLINICALLY
IMPORTANT
