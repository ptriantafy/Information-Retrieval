FAST
MOVING
HAEMOGLOBIN
LETTER
WE
HAVE
MEASURED
FAST
MOVING
COMPONENTS
OF
HAEMOGLOBIN
FMH
IN
NINE
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WITHOUT
ANY
CLINICAL
EVIDENCE
OF
DIABETES
MELLITUS
THE
NINE
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAD
A
MEAN
FMH
OF
93
WHICH
DIFFERED
SIGNIFICANTLY
FROM
97
CONTROLS
WITH
A
MEAN
FMH
OF
76
THERE
WAS
NO
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
FMH
AND
AGE
OR
FMH
AND
DURATION
OF
DISEASE
THE
ABOVE
RESULTS
RAISE
THE
QUESTION
AS
TO
WHAT
EXTENT
THE
FMH
IS
A
REFLECTION
OF
HYPERGLYCAEMIA
OR
INSULINOPENIA
