LETTER
SKIN
WRINKLING
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
LETTER
FROM
PROFESSOR
ELLIOTT
APPEARS
TO
BE
THE
FIRST
RECORD
OF
SKIN
WRINKLING
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
MAY
BE
AN
OBSERVATION
AS
IMPORTANT
AS
THAT
OF
DI
SANT
AGNESE
WHEN
HE
NOTED
THE
HIGH
SALT
CONCENTRATION
OF
THE
SWEAT
IT
SEEMS
THAT
PARENTS
ARE
WELL
AWARE
OF
THIS
RESPONSE
AND
REPEATING
PROFESSOR
ELLIOTTS
OBSERVATION
BY
SOAKING
THE
HANDS
OF
SIX
INFANTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IN
HOT
WATER
SHOWED
THAT
VERY
MARKED
WRINKLING
WAS
PRESENT
BY
FIVE
MINUTES
AND
OFTEN
BY
TWO
MINUTES
THIS
DID
NOT
OCCUR
IN
CONTROL
CHILDREN
OF
SIMILAR
NUTRITIONAL
STATE
EXCEPT
IN
A
CASE
OF
TWINS

ONE
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ONE
WITHOUT

WHERE
THE
UNAFFECTED
CHILDS
FINGERS
BEGAN
TO
WRINKLE
SLIGHTLY
BY
FIVE
MINUTES
THE
WRINKLING
DOES
NOT
APPEAR
TO
BE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
WASTING
DUE
TO
MALNUTRITION
SINCE
IT
OCCURS
EQUALLY
IN
PLUMP
AND
IN
THIN
INFANTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
NOR
IS
IT
PRESENT
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
SEVERE
WASTING
AND
RESPIRATORY
DISEASE
NOT
DUE
TO
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
