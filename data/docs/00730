HAVE
BEEN
CARRIED
OUT
WITH
SIX
PATIENTS
KNOWN
TO
HAVE
PANCREATIC

TO
INVESTIGATE
THE
UTILISATION
OF

PROTEIN

COMPRISING
85
OF

NITROGEN
INTAKE
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF

UTILISATION
SUBSTITUTING
85
OF
THE
DIETARY
PROTEIN
WITH
THE
ENZYMIC
CASEIN
HYDROLYSATE
RESULTED
IN
FURTHER
IMPROVEMENT
IN

BUT
NOT

FOR

ACCOUNTS
FOR
THE
FINDING
ABOVE
WITH
THE

WAS
HIGHER

COMPARED
WITH
THE
EXCRETION
FROM
THE
PARTIAL
CASEIN

AND
PROVIDED
SMALLER
POSITIVE
NITROGEN
BALANCES
THESE
PRELIMINARY
FINDINGS
INDICATE
THAT
FOR
SOME
PATIENTS
WITH
PANCREATIC
INSUFFICIENCY
PARTIAL
HYDROLYSATES
HAVE
GREATER
POTENTIAL
FOR
NITROGEN
RETENTION
THAN
THE
ADMINISTRATION
OF
EXOGENOUS
PANCREATIC
EXTRACTS
WITH
INTACT

IT
IS
SUGGESTED
THAT
A
DAILY
SUPPLEMENT
OF
PREDIGESTED
PROTEIN
MIGHT
BE
ADVANTAGEOUS
FOR
CH
CHILDREN
