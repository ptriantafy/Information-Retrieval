SCREENING
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
BY
ANALYSIS
OF
ALBUMIN
IN
MECONIUM
A
CLINICAL
STUDY
OF
THE
ALBUMIN
CONTENT
IN
MECONIUM
WAS
PERFORMED
ON
TWO
CATEGORIES
OF
NEWBORN
INFANTS
A
SCREENING
SERIES
OF
8830
INFANTS
AND
A
HIGHRISK
GROUP
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
OF
70
INFANTS
A
SINGLE
RADIAL
IMMUNODIFFUSION
TECHNIQUE
AND
TEST
STRIPS
WERE
USED
THREE
CF
INFANTS
WERE
DETECTED
IN
THE
SCREENING
SERIES
13000
AND
16
IN
THE
HIGHRISK
GROUP
THE
DIAGNOSTIC
ACCURACY
FOR
CF
WAS
FAIRLY
GOOD
THE
SPECIFICITY
WAS
998
FOR
THE
IMMUNODIFFUSION
TECHNIQUE
AND
992
FOR
TEST
STRIPS
A
HIGH
CONCENTRATION
OF
ALBUMIN
IN
MECONIUM
WAS
FOUND
NOT
ONLY
IN
CF
BUT
ALSO
IN
PRETERM
BABIES
AND
INFANTS
WITH
GASTROINTESTINAL
DISTURBANCES
SUCH
AS
ATRESIAS
MALAENA
NEONATORUM
AND
MALABSORPTION
SYNDROMES
THE
SENSITIVITY
WAS
90
FOR
THE
IMMUNODIFFUSION
TECHNIQUE
AND
78
FOR
THE
TEST
STRIP
FALSENEGATIVE
RESULTS
WERE
PROBABLY
DUE
TO
PROTEOLYTIC
ACTIVITY
AND
MIGHT
BE
AVOIDED
IF
THE
SAMPLES
ARE
STORED
AT
A
LOW
TEMPERATURE
BEFORE
ANALYSIS
CF
SCREENING
OF
ALL
MECONIUMS
BY
THE
USE
OF
TEST
STRIPS
FOLLOWED
BY
ANALYSIS
OF
POSITIVE
TESTS
BY
THE
IMMUNODIFFUSION
TECHNIQUE
IS
SUGGESTED
