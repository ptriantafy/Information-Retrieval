HETEROZYGOTE
ADVANTAGE
WHEN
A
GENIC
DISORDER
IS
ONLY
MANIFEST
IF
THERE
ARE
OFFENDING
ALLELES
AT
BOTH
LOCI
AS
IN
FIBROCYSTIC
DISEASE
THERE
IS
A
LOSS
OF
TWO
ABNORMAL
ALLELES
WITH
EACH
AFFECTED
BIRTH
SINCE
THE
HOMOZYGOTES
RARELY
REPRODUCE
HOW
IS
THIS
LOSS
COMPENSATED
HOW
COULD
SOME
50000
ALLELES
WHICH
CAN
ONLY
SURVIVE
TO
CONVEY
THEMSELVES
IN
EFFECTIVE
GAMETES
IF
THEY
HAVE
A
NORMAL
ALLELIC
PARTNER
BECOME
ESTABLISHED
IN
THE
BRITISH
ISLES

AND
HOW
HAVE
SOME
HALF
A
MILLION
OR
MORE
GOT
INTO
THE
WORLD
CURRENCY
FIRST
MIGRATIONS
AND
SETTLEMENTS
INVOLVE
THE
PROPORTION
OF
DEFECTIVE
ALLELES
AT
ALL
LOCI
BEING
CONSERVED
BUT
THEIR
VARIETY
BEING
INCREASED
SECONDLY
THERE
COULD
BE
A
GENERAL
TENDENCY
DUE
TO
SOME
ADVANTAGE
IN
HEALTH
OR
VITALITY
WHICH
COULD
BE
MANIFEST
BY
DISEASE
RESISTANCE
COLD
RESISTANCE
AND
BY
ANY
NUMBER
OF
PHYSICAL
OR
PSYCHOLOGICAL
MECHANISMS
THIRDLY
THERE
MAY
BE
COMPENSATION

THAT
IS
THE
DEATH
OF
AN
INFANT
MAY
LEAD
TO
REPLACEMENT
AS
A
RESULT
OF
WHICH
THE
REPLACING
SIB
IF
SURVIVING
WOULD
HAVE
A
23
CHANCE
OF
BEING
A
CARRIER
FOURTHLY
THE
DISEASE
MAY
BE
MAINTAINED
BY
MUTATION
OF
THE
FOUR
POSSIBILITIES
THREE
ARE
UNREALISTIC
SO
THAT
SUBSTANTIAL
SELECTIVE
ADVANTAGE
OF
HETEROZYGOTES
OVER
THE
LAST
FEW
HUNDRED
YEARS
MUST
BE
POSTULATED
