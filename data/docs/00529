HETEROZYGOTES

HOMOZYGOTES
WE
EXAMINED
SERUM
PROTEINS
FROM
18
CF
SUBJECTS
AND
14
CONTROL
INDIVIDUALS
WE
WERE
UNABLE
TO
DETECT
ANY
CONSISTENT
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
STAINED
SERUM
PROTEIN
PATTERNS
OF
THE
CF
AND
THE
CONTROL
SUBJECTS
THESE
PATTERNS
SHOW
GREATER
RESOLUTION
OF
PROTEINS
THAN
THOSE
PREVIOUSLY
PUBLISHED
BUT
IN
CONTRAST
NO
CONSISTENT
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN

SUBJECTS
IN
ADDITION
WE
HAVE
MODIFIED
THE
PUBLISHED
METHODS
WITH
PROCEDURES
WHICH
WOULD
ENHANCE
THE
LIKELIHOOD
OF
ELECTROPHORETIC
DETECTION
OF
AN
ABNORMAL
PROTEIN
WITH
THE
REPORTED
PROPERTIES
A
PORTION
OF
THE

ANALYZED
BY
THE

PROCEDURES
ALSO
WERE
ANALYZED
BY
EACH

THESE
MODIFICATIONS
NONE
OF
THE
MODIFIED
PROCEDURES
SHOWED
CONSISTENT

NO

ATTEMPTED

RIGOROUSLY
REPRODUCE
THE

HOWEVER
ISOELECTRIC
FOCUSING
IN
