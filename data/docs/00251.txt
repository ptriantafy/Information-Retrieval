FURTHER
STUDIES
WERE
NECESSARY
TO
INVESTIGATE
THE
CLINICAL
RELIABILITY
OF
INCREASED
59FE2
ABSORPTION
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
ERYTHROBLASTIC
HYPERPLASIA
WHICH
MAY
CONTROL
THE
REGULATION
OF
IRON
ABSORPTION
BY
IRON
STORES
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
IRON
ABSORPTION
AND
IRON
STORES
WAS
STUDIED
IN
PANCREATIC
INSUFFICIENCY
TO
REINVESTIGATE
THE
EFFECT
OF
PANCREATIC
SECRETION
ON
IRON
ABSORPTION
IRON
ABSORPTION
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
GLUTENSENSITIVE
ENTEROPATHY
WAS
INVESTIGATED
IN
ORDER
TO
CORRELATE
THE
IMPAIRMENT
OF
IRON
ABSORPTION
WITH
THE
DEGREE
OF
VILLOUS
ATROPHY
AND
TO
STUDY
ITS
RECOVERY
ON
A

WAS
MEASURED
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
GASTRIC
MUCOSAL
ATROPHY
AND
PARTIAL
GASTRECTOMY
TO
INVESTIGATE
THE
EXTENT
TO
WHICH
IRON
MALABSORPTION
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
HIGH
INCIDENCE
OF

IN
SUCH

FOR
THE
