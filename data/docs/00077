THE
OBJECTIVE
OF
THIS
INVESTIGATION
WAS
TO
FURTHER
REFINE
A
TECHNIQUE
DEVELOPED
TO
SERVE
AS
A
NEW
TEST
PROCEDURE
FOR
THE
DIAGNOSIS
OF

OF

UTILIZING
A
MORE
QUANTITATIVE
APPROACH
FOR
MEASURING
IN
A
STANDARD
FASHION
THE
VOLUME
OF
SECRETION
OF
THE
MINOR
SALIVARY
GLANDS
OF
THE
LOWER
LABIAL
MUCOSA
WHICH
CAN
BE
COLLECTED
OVER
A
FIXED
PERIOD
OF
TIME
IT
WAS
ALSO
HOPED
THAT
SUCH
STANDARDIZATION
WOULD
FACILITATE
THE
MORE
ACCURATE
STUDY
OF
ALL
ASPECTS
OF
STUDY
OF
MINOR
SALIVARY
GLAND
SECRETION
COLLECTED
IN
THIS
FASHION
FROM
THE
FINDINGS
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
THAT
LESS
MINOR
SALIVARY
GLAND
SECRETION
WAS
COLLECTED
FROM
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
THAN
FROM
NORMAL

USING
A

BE

BEYOND
THE

OF

THE
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
THE
RELATIVE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
VOLUME
OF
MINOR

COLLECTED
AT
A

THAT

DIFFERENCES
IN

HAVE
AGAIN
BEEN
FOUND
TO
BE
DISTINCTIVE
ENOUGH
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
STUDIES
BE
CONTINUED
IN
THIS
AREA

FURTHER
REFINE

AN

IT
IS
