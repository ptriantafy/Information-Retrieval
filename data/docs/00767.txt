NUTRITION
AND
IMMUNITY
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAS
TOO
MUCH
ATTENTION
BEEN
FOCUSED
ON
ANTIBIOTIC
THERAPY
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THEREBY
OVERSHADOWING
OTHER
MEASURES
WHICH
HAVE
LED
TO
THE
IMPROVED
PROGNOSIS
THIS
MAY
WELL
BE
TRUE
AND
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
THAT
REGULAR
INTENSIVE
PHYSIOTHERAPY
PERFORMED
DAILY
BY
THE
PATIENTS
RELATIVES
PLAYS
THE
MAJOR
PART
IN
IMPROVING
AIRWAY
OBSTRUCTION
MORE
SKILFUL
NUTRITIONAL
MANAGEMENT
INCLUDING
ADEQUATE
PANCREATIC
REPLACEMENT
THERAPY
AND
HIGHENERGY
HIGHPROTEIN
DIETS
WILL
ALSO
HAVE
HAD
BENEFICIAL
EFFECTS
ON
THE
RESPIRATORY
DEFECTS
THE
INFECTED
CF
PATIENT
MAY
NOT
REQUIRE
HIGH
DOSES
OF
ANTIBIOTICS
HE
TOO
MIGHT
BENEFIT
MORE
FROM
SIMPLE
NUTRITIONAL
ALTERATIONS
IT
IS
NOT
NEW
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
NUTRITIONAL
FACTORS
ARE
IMPORTANT
INFLUENCES
ON
THE
RESISTANCE
TO
INFECTION
OF
THE
CF
PATIENT
WHAT
WE
CAN
NOW
DO
IS
MEASURE
THE
DIFFERENT
ASPECTS
OF
THE
IMMUNE
RESPONSE
IN
SUCH
PATIENTS
AND
THOSE
WITH
MALNUTRITION
SO
THAT
THE
SIMPLEST
AND
MOST
DIRECT
THERAPY
CAN
BE
CHOSEN
