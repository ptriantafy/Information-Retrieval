STUDY
ASSESSMENT
OF
THE

IN
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAS
SHOWN
THAT
CHANGES
OCCUR
IN
NOT
ONLY
THE
RIGHT
VENTRICLE
BUT
ALSO
IN
THE
LEFT
VENTRICLE
AND
AORTA
AS
COMPARED
WITH
NORMAL
ECHOCARDIOGRAMS
COULD
BE

THE

THE

THROUGHOUT
THE

THIS

DEMONSTRATES
THAT
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
IS
AN
EFFECTIVE
NONINVASIVE
MEANS
OF

IN

THESE
