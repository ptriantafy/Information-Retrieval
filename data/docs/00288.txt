AN
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
EFFECTS
OF
INTESTINAL
MALABSORPTION
ON
PLASMALIPIDS
WE
COMPARED
THE
FATTYACID
COMPOSITION
OF
THE
SERUMLECITHIN
OF
23
PATIENTS
WITH
MALABSORPTION
FROM
A
VARIETY
OF
DIFFERENT
CAUSES
AND
FOUND
SIMILAR
CHANGES
IRRESPECTIVE
OF
THE

OF
THE

THE

EXCEPTION
TO
THIS

THAT
CLASSICAL

WAS
FOUND
ONLY
IN

THERE
IS

THE
RELATIVELY

AMOUNTS
OF
ARACHIDONIC
ACID
REPORTED
IN
SOME
EFA
DEFICIENT
PATIENTS
MAY
NOT
