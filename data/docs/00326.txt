INHALATION
THERAPY
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
INHALATION
THERAPY
CAN
BE
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
TYPES
INTERMITTENT
AEROSOL
THERAPY
WHICH
IS
USED
TO
ADMINISTER
MEDICATIONS
OVER
BRIEF
PERIODS
AND
MIST
TENT
THERAPY
WHICH
IS
USED
FOR
PROLONGED
PERIODS
OF
TREATMENT
THE
PRESENT
STATE
OF
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
BASIC
DEFECT
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
MAKES
IT
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
GIVE
HARD
AND
FAST
GUIDE
LINES
FOR
THE
USE
OF
INHALATION
THERAPY
MUCH
DEPENDS
ON
THE
INDIVIDUAL
EXPERIENCE
OF
THE
PHYSICIAN
AND
THE
DEGREE
OF
PULMONARY
INVOLVEMENT
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
PATIENT
RESPONSE

ASSESSMENT

ANTIBIOTICS

DIFFICULT
ANTIBIOTICS
CAN
BE
USEFUL
IN
HELPING
TO
CLEAR
INFECTION
IN
THOSE
PATIENTS
WITH
EARLY
DISEASE
AS
JUDGED
BY
CLEARING
OF
PATHOGENS
FROM
THE
COUGH
SWAB
OR
SPUTUM
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CHRONIC
COUGH
AND
LARGE
VOLUMES
IF
PURULENT
SPUTUM
WITH
POSITIVE
CULTURE
FROM
GRAM
NEGATIVE
BACTERIA
THE
CULTURES
NEVER
BECOME
NEGATIVE
AND
ONLY
IN
THE
OCCASIONAL
PATIENT
CAN
DEFINITE
CLINICAL
BENEFIT
BE
CLAIMED
A
FEW
SEVERELY
ILL
PATIENTS
HAVE
DRAMATICALLY
IMPROVED
WHEN
THIS
THERAPY
HAS
BEEN
INTRODUCED
AND
THE
PATIENTS
ARE
CONVINCED
OF
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THIS
TREATMENT
IT
IS
OF
COURSE
IMPOSSIBLE
IN
THIS
DISEASE
WITH
SUCH
A
VARYING
CLINICAL
COURSE
TO
PROVE
SCIENTIFICALLY
THAT
THE
INHALATION
THERAPY
WAS
THE
REASON
FOR
THIS
IMPROVEMENT
