THE
PATTERNS
OF
INFECTION
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THIRTYFIVE
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AGED
11
MONTHS
TO
135
YEARS
HAVE
BEEN
INVESTIGATED
WITH
REGARD
TO
RESPIRATORY
SYMPTOMS
RESPIRATORY
TRACT
PATHOGENS
SERUM
IMMUNOGLOBULINS
AND
SERUM
PRECIPITINS
HAEMOPHILUS
INFLUENZAE
WAS
THE
COMMONEST
PATHOGEN
BEING
SUPPLANTED
IN
ADVANCED
DISEASE
BY
PSEUDOMONAS
AERUGINOSA
THE
PATIENTS
WHO
HAD
NO
RESPIRATORY
INFECTION
HAD
LEVELS
OF
IGG
SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER
THAN
NORMAL
CHILDREN
OF
COMPARABLE
AGES
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
SEVERE
RESPIRATORY
INFECTION
THE
IMMUNOGLOBULINS
WERE
RAISED
AND
PRECIPITINS
TO
THE
PREDOMINANT
RESPIRATORY
ORGANISM
WERE
PRESENT
THESE
FINDINGS
DIFFER
FROM
THE
PREVALENT
VIEW
THAT
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAVE
A
NORMAL
RESPONSE
TO
INFECTION
AND
THAT
THE
COMMON
INFECTING
ORGANISM
IS
STAPHYLOCOCCUS
AUREUS
