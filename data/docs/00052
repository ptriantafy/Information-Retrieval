ERYTHROCYTE
MEMBRANE
PROPERTIES
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
BIOCHEMICAL
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
ERYTHROCYTE
MEMBRANE
HAVE
BEEN
STUDIED
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
AND
IN
AGEMATCHED
CONTROLS
NO
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES
COULD
BE
OBSERVED
IN
EITHER
THE
CONCENTRATION
OR
COMPOSITION
OF
THE
PRINCIPAL
MEMBRANE
CONSTITUENTS
CONTRARY
TO
PREVIOUS
REPORTS
WE
FOUND
NORMAL
LEVELS
OF
THE
MG2DEPENDENT
AND
CA2

MG2DEPENDENT
ATPASE
ACTIVITIES
IN
CF
PREPARATIONS
HOWEVER
A
QUALITATIVE
DIFFERENCE
WAS
OBSERVED
IN
THE
CA2DEPENDENT
ATPASE
SINCE
THE
ENZYME
HAD
RELATIVELY
GREATER
ACTIVITY
AT
LOWER
CALCIUM
CONCENTRATIONS
IN
THE
CYSTIC
PREPARATIONS
THIS
EFFECT
ON
THE
MEMBRANEBOUND
CA2ATPASE
IS
UNLIKELY
TO
REPRESENT
A
GENETIC
DEFECT
IN
THE
ENZYME
ITSELF
BUT
IT
MAY
BE
CONNECTED
WITH
THE
MECHANISM
OF
PATHOGENESIS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
