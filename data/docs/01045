THIS

DEMONSTRATES
THE
CLINICAL
FEASIBILITY
OF
ATRAUMATICALLY
MEASURING

EIP
IN
THE
PEDIATRIC
AGE
GROUP
A
TETRAPOLAR
ELECTRODE
SYSTEM
WAS
USED
BECAUSE
OF
ITS
ABILITY
TO
DETECT

PERFORMED
ON
4
CHILDREN
4
TO
15
YEARS

WITH
VARIOUS

ARE
PRESENTED
THE
INFORMATION
OBTAINED
ON
THEIR
REGIONAL
VENTILATION
AND
PULSATILE
PERFUSION
BY
EIP
WAS
FOUND
TO

ABNORMALITIES
WHICH
WERE
NOT
APPARENT
IN
THE

SCAN
BUT
WERE
DEMONSTRATED
BY

IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
TETRAPOLAR
EIP
CAN
PROVIDE
SAFE
RELIABLE
REGIONAL
INFORMATION
ABOUT
VENTILATION
AND
PERFUSION
IN
DISEASED
LUNGS
AND
BECAUSE
OF
ITS
ATRAUMATIC
APPROACH
IS
TECHNICALLY
MOST
SUITABLE
FOR
USE
IN
CHILDREN
