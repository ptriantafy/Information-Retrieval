THIS

DESCRIBES
THE
DEVELOPMENT
AND
APPLICATION
OF
A
NOVEL

TO
DETERMINE
LEVELS
OF
HUMAN

SPECIFIC
THE
ASSAY
OF
IMMUNOREACTIVE
TRYPSIN
SHOULD
BE
AN
IDEAL
MARKER
OF
PANCREATIC
FUNCTION
AND
THIS
IS
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
RESULTS
OF
A
NUMBER
OF
CLINICAL

USE
OF
THIS
ASSAY
IN
STUDIES
OF
CHRONIC
PANCREATITIS
JUVENILEONSET
DIABETES
AND
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAS
YIELDED
MUCH
VALUABLE
DATA
AND
IT
IS
EXPECTED
THAT
FURTHER
RESEARCH
WILL
LEAD
TO
AN
IMPROVED
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THESE
AND
OTHER
CONDITIONS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
