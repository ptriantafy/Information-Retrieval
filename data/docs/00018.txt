SELECTIVE
INHIBITION
OF
PHAGOCYTIC
ACTIVITY
OF
RABBIT
ALVEOLAR
MACROPHAGES
BY
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SERUM
AS
FAR
AS
RABBIT
ALVEOLAR
MACROPHAGES
ARE
CONCERNED
THE
CONCENTRATION
OF
HOMOZYGOUS
CF
SERUM
USED
IN
OUR
EXPERIMENTS
WAS
EVEN
GREATER
THAN
THE
FOURFOLD
CONCENTRATION
WHICH
BIGGAR
AND
ASSOCIATES
STATE
WAS
REQUIRED
FOR
NORMAL
PHAGOCYTOSIS
INCREASING
DILUTIONS
OF
HOMOZYGOUS
CF
SERA
WITH
EITHER
HANKS
BALANCED
SALT
SOLUTION
OR
NORMAL
HUMAN
SERUM
THUS
DECREASING
ITS
CONCENTRATION
INCREASED
THE
CAPACITY
OF
THE
RABBIT
ALVEOLAR
MACROPHAGES
TO
PHAGOCYTIZE
AND
KILL
PSEUDOMONAS
AERUGINOSA
INCREASING
CONCENTRATIONS
HAD
JUST
THE
OPPOSITE
EFFECT
SUSPENSION
OF
RABBIT
ALVEOLAR
MACROPHAGES
IN
HUMAN
SERUM
REDUCED
THEIR
PHAGOCYTIC
ACTIVITY
BUT
ACTIVITY
WAS
REDUCED
MORE
BY
HUMAN
CF
SERUM
THAN
BY
HUMAN
NORMAL
SERUM
THIS
IS
NOT
UNEXPECTED
BECAUSE
HIGH
HUMAN
SERUM
CONCENTRATIONS
ARE
LIKELY
TO
BE
TOXIC
TO
RABBIT
ALVEOLAR
MACROPHAGES
BECAUSE
THE
INHIBITION
OF
PHAGOCYTOSIS
WAS
ABSENT
WHEN
HOMOZYGOUS
CF
SERUM
MORE
THAN
24
HOURS
OLD
OR
PREVIOUSLY
HEATED
OR
FROZEN
WAS
USED
AND
BECAUSE
OF
OUR
OBSERVATIONS
THAT
DILUTION
INCREASED
MACROPHAGE
PHAGOCYTIC
ABILITY
WE
FEEL
OUR
DATA
DEMONSTRATE
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
LABILE
INHIBITOR
RATHER
THAN
A
DEFICIENCY
SINCE
IT
IS
WELL
KNOWN
THAT
CF
PATIENTS
HAVE
NORMAL
OR
ELEVATED
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
IMMUNOGLOBULINS
INCLUDING
IGA
IN
THEIR
SERA
AND
PULMONARY
SECRETIONS
AND
RESPOND
TO
INFECTION
AND
IGA
HAS
NOT
BEEN
SHOWN
TO
BE
ESSENTIAL
FOR
ALVEOLAR
MACROPHAGE
PHAGOCYTOSIS
OF
PSEUDOMONAS
AERUGINOSA
WE
CANNOT
AGREE
THAT
THIS
INHIBITION
IS
DUE
TO
AN
IGA
DEFICIENCY
WE
ALSO
NOTE
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
SERA
USED
IN
THE
EXPERIMENTS
OF
BIGGAR
AND
ASSOCIATES
WERE
STORED
AT
70
DEGREES
C
PERHAPS
THIS
MAY
ACCOUNT
FOR
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
RESULTS
