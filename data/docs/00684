FIBROSIS
THE
SYNDROME
OF
INAPPROPRIATE
SECRETION
OF
ANTIDIURETIC
HORMONE
WAS
OBSERVED
IN
TWO
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
DURING
ACUTE
EXACERBATION
OF
CHRONIC
PULMONARY
DISEASE
IT
WAS
DIAGNOSED
BY
THE
ACCEPTED
CLINICAL
AND
LABORATORY
CRITERIA
AND
CONFIRMED
IN
ONE
CASE
BY
VALUES
FOR
IMMUNOREACTIVE
VASOPRESSIN
THAT
WERE
INAPPROPRIATELY
HIGH
FOR
PLASMA
OSMOLALITY
THE
SEVERE
HYPONATREMIA
WAS
CORRECTED
BY
FLUID
RESTRICTION
ALONE
OR
COMBINED
WITH
INTRAVENOUS
TREATMENT
WITH
DIURETIC
AND
HYPERTONIC
SALINE
SOLUTION
IN
ADDITION
THERE
WAS
SIMULTANEOUS
THERAPY
OF
THE
PULMONARY
DISEASE
SIADH
THUS
MUST
BE
ADDED
TO
SALT
LOSS
AS
A
CAUSE
OF
HYPONATREMIA
IN
CF
AND
MAY
BE
MORE
COMMON
THAN
REALIZED
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
AND
SEVERE
PULMONARY
DISEASE
