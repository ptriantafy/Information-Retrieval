THE
PREVALENCE
OF
COELIAC
DISEASE
AND
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IN
IRELAND
SCOTLAND
ENGLAND
AND
WALES
ADMISSIONS
TO
HOSPITAL
IN
THE
REPUBLIC
OF
IRELAND
IN
SCOTLAND
AND
IN
ENGLAND
AND
WALES
FOR
COELIAC
DISEASE
AND
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ARE
COMPARED
ADMISSIONS
TO
HOSPITAL
IN
1972
FOR
COELIAC
DISEASE
IN
THE
REPUBLIC
OF
IRELAND

WHICH
DOES
NOT
YET
HAVE
FULL
RETURNS
OF
HOSPITAL
ADMISSIONS

WAS
APPROXIMATELY
THREE
TIMES
GREATER
THAN
THE
NUMBER
EXPECTED
BASED
UPON
THE
RATES
IN
ENGLAND
AND
WALES
IN
196971
IN
SCOTLAND
THE
ADMISSION
RATES
FOR
COELIAC
DISEASE
WERE
ABOUT
TWICE
THE
EXPECTED
NUMBER
BASED
UPON
THE
ENGLISH
RATES
THIS
CONTRASTED
WITH
ADMISSIONS
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WHICH
WERE
ONLY
SLIGHTLY
HIGHER
IN
IRELAND
AND
IN
SCOTLAND
THAN
IN
ENGLAND
AND
WALES

EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
HIGH
ADMISSION
RATES
FOR
COELIAC
DISEASE
REPRESENT
A
GENUINELY
HIGH
RATE
IN
THE
COMMUNITY
ADMISSION
RATES
FOR
COELIAC
DISEASE
WERE
AS
HIGH
IN
THE
EAST
AND
SOUTH
OF
IRELAND
AS
IN
THE
WEST
IN
IRELAND
THE
POTATO
AND
NOT
THE
WHEATEN
BREAD
WAS
THE
STAPLE
DIET
BEFORE
THE
GREAT
FAMINE
OF
THE
1840S
IN
NINETEENTHCENTURY
SCOTLAND
TOO
LESS
WHEATEN
BREAD
WAS
EATEN
THAN
IN
ENGLAND
AND
WALES
IN
THE
PAST
THEREFORE
COELIAC
DISEASE
WOULD
NOT
BE
AS
DISADVANTAGEOUS
IN
IRELAND
AND
TO
A
LESS
EXTENT
IN
SCOTLAND
AS
IN
ENGLAND
AND
WALES
