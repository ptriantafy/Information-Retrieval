THE
COMPARISON
OF
PEAK
FLOW
RATE
WITH
OTHER
SPIROMETRIC
MEASUREMENTS
IN
CYCTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
THIS
STUDY
WAS
DONE
TO
DETERMINE
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
WRIGHT
PEAK
FLOWMETER
FOR
EVALUATION
OF
PULMONARY
FUNCTIONS
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PEAK
EXPIRATORY
FLOW
RATE
WAS
MEASURED
WITH
THE
USE
OF
A
WRIGHT
PEAK
FLOWMETER
AND
ONE
SECOND
FORCED
EXPIRATORY
VOLUME
MAXIMAL
MIDEXPIRATORY
FLOW
RATE
AND
MAXIMAL
VOLUNTARY
VENTILATION
WERE
MEASURED
WITH
A
SPIROMETER
IN
A
TOTAL
OF
55
CHILDREN
25
OF
WHOM
HAD
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
DISEASE
WITH
THE
REMAINDER
BEING
NORMAL
MEASUREMENTS
WERE
REPEATED
AFTER
ADMINISTRATION
OF
BRONCHODILATING
DRUGS
TO
THE
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
ALL
THE
VALUES
OF
THE
FOUR
MEASUREMENTS
WERE
DECREASED
SIGNIFICANTLY
IN
THE
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
POSITIVE
AND
SIGNIFICANT
CORRELATION
COEFFICIENTS
WERE
OBTAINED
BY
COMPARING
THE
PEAK
FLOW
RATE
WITH
OTHER
SPIROMETRIC
MEASUREMENTS
IT
WAS
CONCLUDED
THAT
PEAK
EXPIRATORY
FLOW
RATE
IS
A
FEASIBLE
AND
USEFUL
MEASUREMENT
OF
PULMONARY
FUNCTIONS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
NO
CHANGES
WERE
OBSERVED
AFTER
ADMINISTRATION
OF
BRONCHODILATING
DRUGS
TO
THESE
PATIENTS
