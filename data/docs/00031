THE
HYPOTHESIS
THAT
MIST
TENT
THERAPY
DECREASES
THE
VISCOSITY
OF
SPUTUM
BY
DIRECT
LIQUEFACTION
OF
THE
SPUTUM
IN
THE
LOWER
RESPIRATORY
TRACT
WAS
TESTED
IN
6
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
THE
FIRST
NIGHT
ALL
PATIENTS
SLEPT
WITHOUT
THE
MIST
TENT
AND
THE
FIRST
MORNING
SPUTUM
WAS
COLLECTED
FOR
ANALYSIS
THE
FOLLOWING
2
NIGHTS
PATIENTS
WERE
RANDOMLY
ALLOCATED
TO
A
TENT
SUPPLIED
BY
EITHER
A
JET
OR
ULTRASONIC
NEBULIZER
THE
EARLY
MORNING
SPUTUM
WAS
ANALYSED
FOR

AND

WAS

FURTHERMORE
THERE
WAS
NO
CONSISTENT
RELATION
BETWEEN

EXPECTORATED
AND
THE
PRESENCE

OF
AN
8HOUR
STAY
IN
THE
TENT
WITH
EITHER
METHOD

THESE
RESULTS
THEREFORE
SUGGEST
THAT
MIST

DOES
NOT
CONSISTENTLY
INFLUENCE
