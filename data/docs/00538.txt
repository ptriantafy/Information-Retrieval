THE
PAPERS
BY
ELLIOTT
AND
BY
CAMPBELL
ET
AL
SUGGEST
A
NEW
APPROACH
TOWARD
ETIOLOGY
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
AND
THERAPY
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC

REMARKABLY

PARTICULARLY
IN

TO

THE
PAPER
OF
CAMPBELL
ET
AL
SUGGESTS
THAT
OXYGEN
DOES
NOT
SIMPLY
DIFFUSE
ACROSS
MEMBRANES
BUT
THAT
INSTEAD
ITS
TRANSPORT
IS
INFLUENCED
BY
THE
FATTY
ACID
COMPOSITION
OF
THE
MEMBRANE
ELLIOTTS
SUGGESTION
THAT
THE
DISARRANGED
FATTY
ACID
METABOLISM
MAY
BE
RELATED
TO
ALTERED
PROSTAGLANDIN
PRODUCTION
IS
ATTRACTIVE
THESE
STUDIES
DO
NOT
PROVE
WHETHER
FATTY
ACID
ANDOR
PROSTAGLANDIN
ALTERATIONS
ARE
SECONDARY
TO
INTESTINAL
FAT
MALABSORPTION
OR
ARE
