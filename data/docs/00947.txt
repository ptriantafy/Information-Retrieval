THE
RIGHT
PARATRACHEAL
STRIPE
IN
CHILDREN
THE
WIDTH
OF
THE
RIGHT
PARATRACHEAL
STRIPE
RPS
HAS
BEEN
ESTABLISHED
IN
NORMAL
ADULTS
BUT
NOT
IN
NORMAL
CHILDREN
THE
THYMUS
AND
GREAT
VESSELS
ARE
RELATIVELY
LARGER
IN
CHILDREN
THAN
IN
ADULTS
AND
COULD
OBSCURE
OR
WIDEN
THE
RPS
WE
FOUND
THAT
OBSCURATION
DOES
OCCUR
AND
THEREFORE
THE
RPS
IS
LESS
OFTEN
MEASURABLE
IN
CHILDREN
THAN
IN
ADULTS
WIDENING
BY
THE
THYMUS
AND
GREAT
VESSELS
HOWEVER
DOES
NOT
OCCUR
THE
WIDTH
OF
THE
RPS
IN
NORMAL
CHILDREN
05
TO
30
MM
IS
SLIGHTLY
LESS
THAN
IN
ADULTS
FROM
THIS
STUDY
OF
NORMAL
CHILDREN
AND
OUR
SUBSEQUENT
EXPERIENCE
WITH
PEDIATRIC
PATIENTS
WE
CONCLUDE
THAT
IN
A
CHILD
AN
RPS
4
MM
OR
WIDER
IS
RELIABLE
EVIDENCE
OF
DISEASE
AFFECTING
THE
TRACHEA
MEDIASTINUM
OR
PLEURA
