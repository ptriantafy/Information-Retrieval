CONFIRMATION
OF
THE
DIAGNOSIS
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
RECENT
COMMERCIAL
INTRODUCTION
OF
A
METHOD
FOR
DETECTING
ALBUMIN
IN
MECONIUM
MAKES
SCREENING
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
FEASIBLE
FOR
MANY
HOSPITALS
IF
THE
TESTS
IS
ADOPTED
CONFIRMATORY
TESTS
SHOULD
BE
AVAILABLE
QUANTITATIVE
ANALYSES
OF
SWEAT
FOR
SODIUM
BY
FLAME
PHOTOMETRY
AND
FOR
CHLORIDE
BY
SILVER
TITRATION
AND
IONSLEECTIVE
ELECTRODES
ARE
NOW
USED
AS
CONFIRMATORY
TESTS
WE
COMPARE
RESULTS
OF
THESE
CONFIRMATORY
METHODS
APPLIED
TO
PRESONS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
