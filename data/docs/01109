THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
ADDITIONAL
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
VARIABILITY
AND
INDEPENDENCE
OF
THE
INVOLVEMENT
OF
THE
SWEAT
GLANDS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
A

REPORT
OF

GIRL
WHO
DIED
AT
AGE
9
YEARS
OF
PROGRESSIVE
PULMONARY

IS
PRESENTED
THE
CASE
INDICATES
THAT
FATAL
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
OR
A
VARIANT
THEREOF
CAN
EXIST
WITH
NORMAL
LEVELS
OF
SWEAT
CHLORIDE
AND
THAT
THE
PULMONARY
DISEASE
DEVELOPS
INDEPENDENTLY
OF
