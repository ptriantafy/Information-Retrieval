THE
EFFECTS
OF
SERUM
FROM
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
FROM
NORMAL
CHILDREN
ON
THE
MUCUSSECRETING
CILIATED
EPITHELIUM
HAVE
BEEN
INVESTIGATED
IN
VITRO
USING
EXPLANTED
TISSUE
FROM
RABBIT
LUNG
BY
OPTICAL
AND
SCANNING
ELECTRON
MICROSCOPY
A
SEQUENCE
OF
STRUCTURAL
CHANGES
IS
OBSERVED
AFTER
INCUBATION
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SERUM
THIS
SEQUENCE
DOES
NOT
OCCUR
WITH
NORMAL
SERUM
THE
EARLIEST
CHANGES
INVOLVE
SWELLING
OF
THE
GOBLET
CELLS
WITH
SUBSEQUENT
DISCHARGE
OF
MUCUS
ONTO
THE
EPITHELIAL
SURFACE
THIS
IS
FOLLOWED
BY
DISRUPTION
OF
THE
NORMALLY
RAPID
AND
SYNCHRONIZED
CILIARY
ACTIVITY
MUCUS
GRADUALLY
EXTENDS
OVER
THE
SURFACE
ENTANGLING
CILIA
FINALLY
SOME
SHEDDING
OF
CILIATED
CELLS
OCCURS
FROM
THE
EPITHELIUM
THESE
FINDINGS
SUGGEST
THAT
FACTORS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SERUM
CAUSE
DISCHARGE
OF
MUCUS
LEADING
TO
A
DISTURBANCE
OF
THE
NORMAL
CILIARY
ACTIVITY
IN
THE
RABBIT
LUNG
IT
IS
POSTULATED
THAT
SUCH
CHANGES
RESULT
IN
DYSFUNCTION
OF
THE
MUCOCILIARY
CLEARANCE
MECHANISM
AND
THAT
THIS
DYSFUNCTION
MAY
BE
A
CONTRIBUTORY
FACTOR
TO
THE
PATHOGENESIS
OF
LUNG
DISEASE
