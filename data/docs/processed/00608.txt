abnorm respons of cultur lymphocyt to phytohemagglutinin and autolog serum in cystic fibrosi lymphocyt from adult homozyg or heterozyg for cystic fibrosi show biochem abnorm when cultur for 48 hour in the presenc of phytohemagglutinin and autolog serum in contrast to the 45 per cent increas in total protein and betaglucuronidas concentr seen in healthi control subject when measur per 1010 cell both concentr decreas by 1 per cent in adult heterozyg for cystic fibrosi and by 18 per cent in adult homozyg for cystic fibrosi the abnorm respons of the lymphocyt from person with cystic fibrosi wa due to a serum factor and not to ani intrins abnorm of the lymphocyt an abnorm respons to hytohemagglutinin occur in onli 14 per cent of 44 healthi control subject but in 100 per cent of 14 adult homozyg for cystic fibrosi and in 85 per cent of 26 adult presum to be heterozyg for cystic fibrosi as a result of thi phenomenon lymphocyt betaglucuronidas concentr were significantli lower than normal in patient with cystic fibrosi when the cell were cultur with phytohemagglutinin and autolog serum the demonstr of thi phenomenon in both homozygot and presum heterozygot parent suggest a relationship to the genet defect in cystic fibrosi
