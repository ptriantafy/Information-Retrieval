cystic fibrosi leakag of lysosom enzym and of alkalin phosphatas into the extracellular space nine lysom enzym and alkalin phosphatas have been assay with two differ ultramicro techniqu in the intra and extracellular space of fibroblast cultur deriv from the skin of cystic fibrosi patient cystic fibrosi carrier and normal control respect evid ha been obtain for a multipl leakag of lysom enzym and of alkalin phosphatas into the medium of fibroblast cultur from cystic fibrosi patient and carrier the situat is compar to a certain extent to that observ in icelldiseas mucolipidosi ii thi multipl leakag result in the decreas of intracellular activ of sever lysosom enzym in cultur from cystic fibrosi patient and carrier and due to the coordin regulationof the synthesi of the leaki enzym in an overshoot of the intracellular alkalin phosphatas activ in cultur from cystic fibrosi patient it also explain the retard catabol of certain molecul such as the tammhorsfal glycoprotein in cystic fibrosi cell it is specul that the basic defect in cystic fibrosi lead to abnorm recognit site on lysosom enzym and on alkalin phosphatas and in consequ to the leakag of those enzym into the extracellular space the present find allow one to develop method for the pre and postnat diagnosi of cystic fibrosi with cell cultur and for the detect of cystic fibrosi carrier with the peripher blood
