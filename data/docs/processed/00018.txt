letter select inhibit of phagocyt activ of rabbit alveolar macrophag by cystic fibrosi serum as far as rabbit alveolar macrophag are concern the concentr of homozyg cf serum use in our experi wa even greater than the fourfold concentr which biggar and associ state wa requir for normal phagocytosi increas dilut of homozyg cf sera with either hank balanc salt solut or normal human serum thu decreas it concentr increas the capac of the rabbit alveolar macrophag to phagocyt and kill pseudomona aeruginosa increas concentr had just the opposit effect suspens of rabbit alveolar macrophag in human serum reduc their phagocyt activ but activ wa reduc more by human cf serum than by human normal serum thi is not unexpect becaus high human serum concentr are like to be toxic to rabbit alveolar macrophag becaus the inhibit of phagocytosi wa absent when homozyg cf serum more than 24 hour old or previous heat or frozen wa use and becaus of our observ that dilut increas macrophag phagocyt abil we feel our data demonstr the presenc of a labil inhibitor rather than a defici sinc it is well known that cf patient have normal or elev concentr of immunoglobulin includ iga in their sera and pulmonari secret and respond to infect and iga ha not been shown to be essenti for alveolar macrophag phagocytosi of pseudomona aeruginosa we cannot agre that thi inhibit is due to an iga defici we also note that some of the sera use in the experi of biggar and associ were store at 70 degre c perhap thi may account for the differ in result
