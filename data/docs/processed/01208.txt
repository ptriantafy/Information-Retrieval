laser lightscatt spectroscopi preliminari result on bioassay of cystic fibrosi factor the effect of 7 cystic fibrosi sera and 4 normal sera wa investig in 37 cultur of ciliat epithelium of the rabbit trachea serum wa introduc in the rose cultur chamber in a concentr of 10 by volum the frequenc of ciliari beat wa monitor by laser lightscatt spectroscopi the result show that the respons of cilia to sera can be well character by laser light scatter our preliminari evid suggest that an earli increas in the frequenc of ciliari beat follow by rapid arrest of ciliari activ is a sensit and characterist respons produc by cystic fibrosi serum and not by normal serum
