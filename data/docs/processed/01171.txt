complement activ and pulmonari inflamm in cf patient thi studi examin whether biolog activ of c3 with subsequ pulmonari inflamm take place in the lung of patient with cystic fibrosi plasma complement c3 level were all normal eleven of the patient with the c3 split product c3c were from the group of 14 patient suffer from chronic infect with mucoid strain of pseudomona aeruginosa and 2 were from the group of 14 cf patient without p aeruginosa infect thi differ wa signific p 0002 a comparison of albumin ratio between the 13 patient with the c3 split product c3c and the remain other 15 patient show a signific higher ratio in the former group p 001 on an averag 41 versu 14 per cent the significantli higher albumin ratio demonstr in the patient with c3c in their sputum sol phase support the concept of complementinduc inflamm with subsequ transud of plasma protein in these patient thi studi thu show that complementmedi inflammatori reaction may play an import role in the pathogenesi of pulmonari tissu damag in patient with cf even when the plasma c3 level are normal and it support the concept of chronic p aeruginosa lung infect as an immun complex diseas in cf patient
