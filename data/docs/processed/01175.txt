sulphated glycoprotein pancreas several report indicated presence abnormally high amount sulphate mucous gland patient cystic fibrosis bearing fact mind suspected abnormal oversulphated strongly anionic glycoprotein might involved pathogenesis cf present study carried determine whether sulphated bloodgroup substance occur normal pancreatic tissue distribution sulphate exocrine part pancreas coincide distribution bloodgroup substance previously observed fluorescent microscopy therefore find likely sulphate bloodgroup substance associated glycoprotein molecule since bloodgroup substance demonstrated many secretion man since high amount sulphate found mucous gland cf mechanism possible many location may thus offer explanation multiorgan involvement cf
