sulphat glycoprotein in the pancrea sever report have indic the presenc of abnorm high amount of sulphat in the mucou gland of patient with cystic fibrosi bear these fact in mind we suspect that abnorm oversulph and strongli anion glycoprotein might be involv in the pathogenesi of cf the present studi wa carri out to determin whether sulphat bloodgroup substanc occur in normal pancreat tissu the distribut of sulphat over the exocrin part of pancrea doe coincid with the distribut of bloodgroup substanc previous observ by fluoresc microscopi we therefor find it veri like that the sulphat and bloodgroup substanc are associ with the same glycoprotein molecul sinc bloodgroup substanc ha been demonstr in mani secret in man and sinc high amount of sulphat have been found in the mucou gland in cf such a mechan is possibl in mani locat and may thu offer an explan for the multiorgan involv in cf
