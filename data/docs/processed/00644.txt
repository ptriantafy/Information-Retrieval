acidsolubl glycoprotein in amniot fluid and cystic fibrosi of the foetu we suggest that the intrauterin detect of cystic fibrosi may be base on the investig of the amniot fluid it is known that the protein content of the meconium of homozygot newborn infant is significantli increas wherea that of heterozygot infant is onli moder increas as a result of intrauterin intestin activ the bowel content may be excret into the amniot fluid thu a detect deviat in the protein content of amniot fluid may be expect we decid to determin the total protein content and the amount of acidsolubl glycoprotein in 86 amniot fluid sampl both by polographi and by measur the hexos content in the homozyg case a slight increas wa observ in total protein content wherea in the heterozyg case no chang were observ
