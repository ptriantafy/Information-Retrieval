simple technique detection cystic fibrosis heterozygote homozygote examined serum protein 18 cf subject 14 control individual unable detect consistent difference stained serum protein pattern cf control subject pattern show greater resolution protein previously published contrast consistent difference cf control subject addition modified published method procedure would enhance likelihood electrophoretic detection abnormal protein reported property portion sample analyzed published procedure also analyzed modification none modified procedure showed consistent difference serum protein cf control subject explanation readily apparent difference result thomas et al result one hand previously reported result attempted rigorously reproduce isoelectric focusing technique given literature however isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel affected small technical difference thus factor essential reproducing technique may evident published procedure
