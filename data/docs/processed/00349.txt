the comparison of peak flow rate with other spirometr measur in cyctic fibrosi patient thi studi wa done to determin the role of the wright peak flowmet for evalu of pulmonari function in children with cystic fibrosi peak expiratori flow rate wa measur with the use of a wright peak flowmet and one second forc expiratori volum maxim midexpiratori flow rate and maxim voluntari ventil were measur with a spiromet in a total of 55 children 25 of whom had cystic fibrosi diseas with the remaind be normal measur were repeat after administr of bronchodil drug to the cystic fibrosi patient all the valu of the four measur were decreas significantli in the cystic fibrosi patient posit and signific correl coeffici were obtain by compar the peak flow rate with other spirometr measur it wa conclud that peak expiratori flow rate is a feasibl and use measur of pulmonari function in cystic fibrosi patient no chang were observ after administr of bronchodil drug to these patient
