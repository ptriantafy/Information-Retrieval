a compar studi of inhal atropin sulfat and isoproterenol hydrochlorid in cystic fibrosi to investig the contribut of vagal tone to the obstruct airway diseas in cystic fibrosi we evalu the pulmonari function respons to administr of 01 mg of atropin sulfat per kg of bodi weight 005 mg of isoproterenol hydrochlorid per kg of bodi weight or isoton salin control solut administ by nebul on 3 differ day to each of 10 patient with cystic fibrosi in a singl blind studi the dose of atropin sulfat and isoproterenol hydrochlorid were base on publish doserespons characterist of the drug each day thorac ga volum and airway resist were measur in a volum displac bodi plethysmograph and maxim expiratori flowvolum curv were perform befor and at 15 30 and 60 min after the inhal after inhal of salin group mean valu for all pulmonari function indic greater airway obstruct at 15 30 and 60 min when compar to pretreat valu after inhal of isoproterenol and atropin signific improv p 005 wa note in maxim expiratori flow at 60 per cent of total lung capac specif airway conduct thorac ga volum and residu volum inhal of atropin also significantli improv maxim expiratori flow at 25 per cent of vital capac isoproterenol increas the mean flow by 8 to 46 per cent abov baselin and decreas thorac ga volum and residu volum by 11 to 16 per cent with the maxim respons at 15 or 30 min atropin increas mean flow by 15 to 77 per cent and decreas thorac ga volum and residu volum by 16 to 25 per cent with the maxim effect at 30 to 60 min the mean respons to atropin express as a percentag of baselin wa alway greater than or equal to that for isoproterenol we conclud that vagal tone which may reflect increas irrit receptor activ contribut to the obstruct pulmonari function in cystic fibrosi inhal of atropin sulfat will decreas the pulmonari function abnorm but side effect prohibit it clinic use
