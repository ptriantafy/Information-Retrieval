aspect of serum and sputum antibodi in chronic airway obstruct immunoglobulin level and precipit antibodi against a rang of microbi antigen were measur in simultan collect serum and sputum sampl from patient with chronic bronchiti 11 cystic fibrosi 9 bronchiectasi 9 and asthma 4 sputum wa prepar by dialysi and highspe centrifug method result show that it wa possibl to detect precipit antibodi in the sputum and the rate wa increas when both method were use a discrep wa note between the detect rate in the sputum and serum thi combin with the lack of correl between sputum and serum immunoglobulin lack of relationship between bronchial inflamm and sputum immunoglobulin and the lack of igm in the sputum suggest that the antibodi and immunoglobulin were local produc sputum iga 7s in patient with chronic bronchiti wa significantli lower p less than 005 than that found in patient with cystic fibrosi and bronchiectasi signific differ p less than 0 05 were also note in serum igg level between patient with chronic bronchiti bronchiectasi and cystic fibrosi while serum igm level in patient with chronic bronchiti were significantli lower p less than 005 when compar to serum level in patient with cystic fibrosi the presenc of precipit antibodi in the sputum rais the possibl that type iii reaction may be import in the pathogenesi of these condit
