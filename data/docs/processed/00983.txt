precipit antibodi against escherichia coli bacteroid fragili ss thetaiotaomicron and pseudomona aeruginosa in serum from normal person and cystic fibrosi patient determin by mean of cross immunoelectrophoresi serum from normal person and from 133 cystic fibrosi patient wa examin for precipitin against faecal bacteria e coli and b fragili and against p aeruginosa by mean of cross immunoelectrophoresi 27 of the normal sera contain 12 precipitin against e coli 16 contain one precipitin against b fragili and 6 contain one precipitin against p aeruginosa in sera from cystic fibrosi patient there wa a significantli increas preval of precipitin against e coli 76 b fragili 38 and p aeruginosa 63 and the mean number of precipitin against each of these bacteria wa 3 rang 112 14 rang 14 and 16 rang 160 respect increas number of precipitin against p aeruginosa were correl with chronic lung infect caus by thi speci and with poor prognosi wherea such associ were not reveal as regard precipitin against the two other bacteri speci increas number of precipitin against e coli and b fragili were significantli associ with increas number of precipitin against p aeruginosa it is suggest that thi associ is due to immun reaction in the intestin mucosa result in increas absorpt of antigen from the gut
