cystic fibrosi enzymat detect of a ciliostat factor the ciliostat cystic fibrosi cf factor ha been investig in order to develop an enzymat assay for it detect in saliva thi factor is associ with alphaamylas remov or addit of the factor by dialysi doe not affect the alphaamylas catalyt activ of cf or control normal saliva crude prepar of the dialyz factor from cf saliva are ciliostat alphaamylas catalyz starch hydrolysi from both cf and control saliva wa found to be insensit to hydroxyalkylamin inhibitor so thi method could not be use to detect differ in cf and control amylas sinc anoth carbohydras mammalian debranch enzym is much more sensit to inhibit the effect of the isol crude factor on thi enzym wa determin the mean valu for percentag of inhibit of debranch enzym activ by fraction obtain from saliva of cf patient oblig heterozygot and control subject are 32 27 sampl 13 21 sampl and 6 11 sampl respect fifteen of the cf valu exce the maximum 13 inhibit observ for control inde five sampl almost complet inhibit debranch enzym thi inhibitori action provid the basi of an enzymat assay for the detect of the ciliostat cf factor
