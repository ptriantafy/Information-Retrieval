defici of arginin esteras in cystic fibrosi of the pancrea demonstr of the proteolyt natur of the activ proteolyt activ defin as the hydrolysi of peptid bond involv the carboxyl group of larginin in plasma of patient with cystic fibrosi heterozygot and control subject ha been assay use a fluorometr method with protamin as the substrat and fluorescamin as the reagent the mean total proteolyt activ in plasma of patient with cystic fibrosi wa approxim onehalf the mean total activ in control subject and heterozygot the mean proteolyt activ inhibit by soybean trypsin inhibitor in plasma of patient with cystic fibrosi wa approxim onethird that of control subject and heterozygot the relationship of arginin esteras activ to proteolyt activ wa investig the ph optimum and action of revers and irrevers inhibitor were similar for both activ suggest that the arginin esteras activ and proteolyt activ repres similar catalyt entiti these find are consist with our hypothesi that the basic defect in cystic fibrosi may resid in the defici of a proteolyt enzym which result in the accumul of the variou cation macromolecular factor describ by other investig in serum of patient with cystic fibrosi the demonstr of a defici of proteolyt activ as assay by the hydrolysi of protamin a cation polypeptid could explain the presenc of ciliotox cation protein or polypeptid factor in serum of patient with cystic fibrosi and may in some unknown manner be relat to the clinic manifest of the diseas
