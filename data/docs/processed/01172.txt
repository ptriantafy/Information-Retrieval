protein iga secretori iga igg and electrolyt as paramet of parotid gland function in children with cystic fibrosi to studi the parotid gland function in children with cystic fibrosi we investig parotid saliva specimen of 18 such patient we compar the result with a control group of 12 healthi children of the same age and sex furthermor children with bronchial asthma and chronic bronchiti were examin the flow rate of the parotid and the protein output without stimul were nearli the same for the four group in patient with cf the protein output after stimul wa significantli lower an increas level of sodium wa observ in the stimul secret and the unstimul saliva as well in cf children we found a signific higher output of sodium in both stimul parotid saliva and unstimul parotid saliva the igg output of the gland after stimul wa found to be slightli reduc in patient with cf in comparison to healthi children the output of the gland for iga after stimul wa observ to be strongli reduc for the group with cf and for the group with bronchial asthma the decreas output of the gland for secretori iga after stimul wa demonstr again in cf and in bronchial asthma in comparison with healthi person the increas sodium concentr in parotid saliva may be caus in a similar way as the electrolyt abnorm of sweat in cf patient name by a decreas net reabsorpt of sodium due to the result of an increas electrolyt output and decreas immunoglobulin output of parotid gland we can suppos that the molecular magnitud play it role in thi disturb
