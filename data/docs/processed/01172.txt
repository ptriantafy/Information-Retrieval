protein iga secretory iga igg electrolyte parameter parotid gland function child cystic fibrosis study parotid gland function child cystic fibrosis investigated parotid saliva specimen 18 patient compared result control group 12 healthy child age sex furthermore child bronchial asthma chronic bronchitis examined flow rate parotid protein output without stimulation nearly four group patient cf protein output stimulation significantly lower increased level sodium observed stimulated secretion unstimulated saliva well cf child found significant higher output sodium stimulated parotid saliva unstimulated parotid saliva igg output gland stimulation found slightly reduced patient cf comparison healthy child output gland iga stimulation observed strongly reduced group cf group bronchial asthma decreased output gland secretory iga stimulation demonstrated cf bronchial asthma comparison healthy person increased sodium concentration parotid saliva may caused similar way electrolyte abnormality sweat cf patient namely decreased net reabsorption sodium due result increased electrolyte output decreased immunoglobulin output parotid gland suppose molecular magnitude play role disturbance
