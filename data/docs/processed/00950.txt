cystic fibrosi isol and physic properti of a salivari cystic fibrosi factor a ciliostat factor ha been isol from cystic fibrosi cf saliva by dialyz it from purifi alphaamylas prepar by a glycogencomplex method thi method of isol the cf factor is an improv over the previous employ heparin procedur the activ of the isol factor is proport with concentr use the oyster gill ciliostat assay and in it inhibit of mammalian glycogen debranch enzym the ciliostat action of the factor can be revers by heparin under certain condit the type of inhibit of the debranch enzym by the isol cf factor indic that it chemic structur is similar to that observ with hydroxyalkylamin and polyamin metabolit physic properti of the isol factor indic that it is of low molecular weight and is labil as a function of ph and temperatur at neutral ph the condit under which it is maintain have a direct effect on the length of time that it is stabl
