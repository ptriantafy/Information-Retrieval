abnorm breakdown of alpha2macroglobulintrypsin complex in cystic fibrosi the complex of trypsin with purifi alpha2macroglobulin from normal and patient with cystic fibrosi wa studi the form complex fail to reveal ani proteolyt activ toward a high molecular weight substrat wherea the esterolyt activ toward a low molecular weight substrat wa retain thi esterolyt activ wa resist to inhibit by a high molecular weight inhibitor dure iincub at 38 degre c the complex with normal alpha2macroglobulin wa slowli inhibit by the high molecular weight inhibitor and regain activ with the high molecular weight substrat thi phenomenon wa not obtain when the alpha2 macroglobulin from cystic fibrosi wa examin these data suggest that the gradual convers of normal alpha2macroglobulintrypsin complex into an alpha2macroglobulin fragmenttrypsin complex is defici in patient with cystic fibrosi
