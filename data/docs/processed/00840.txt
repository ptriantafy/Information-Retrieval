dexamethasoneresist cystic fibrosi fibroblast show crossresist to sex steroid diploid skin fibroblast deriv from individu with the autosom recess diseas cystic fibrosi cf were shown previous to be significantli more resist to the cytotox of dexamethason a glucocorticoid hormon than were normal human fibroblast here cystic fibrosi fibroblast are also shown to be more resist than normal human fibroblast to the cytotox effect of the sex hormon 17 betaestradiol dihydrotestosteron and progesteron sinc cell are believ to contain differ receptor for each of the steroid hormon it is not probabl than the resist of cf cell to these hormon result from a receptor defici thi wa shown by the fact that cf cell were found to exhibit the same receptor activ as normal cell for 3hdexamethason furthermor neither normal human nor cf fibroblast could be demonstr to contain detect receptor activ for 3h17 betaestradiol in addit the studi of fibroblast kill by hormon led to the further interest observ that normal human diploid fibroblast regardless of the sex of the tissu donor are sensit to kill by each of the sex hormon these find suggest that the cytotox effect of the steroid hormon may be observ independ of the specif hormon receptor the studi report here thu suggest that the resist of cf cell to the differ steroid hormon is probabl the result of a defect in a pathway in cellular steroid hormon metabol other than that involv receptor
