lung elast recoil in cystic fibrosi the pressurevolum behavior of the lung wa studi in 24 patient with cystic fibrosi isovolum flowpressur relationship were measur in 7 of these patient and a modif of the flowvolum test wa evalu for detect of flow reduct in a separ group of 63 patient rel to result in a control group of 31 normal subject 13 of the 24 patient had grossli abnorm pressurevolum curv with excess stiff of the lung near maximum volum and loss of recoil at lower volum close volum in these patient were often high enough to caus signific disturb in ga exchang and the elev close volum were quantit explain by the low valu for elast recoil the modifi flowvolum test detect mild flow reduct in mani patient who otherwis had normal pulmonari function test loss of recoil per se did not account for the low maximum expiratori flow sinc upstream resist were high howev pressureflow curv were effortdepend at high lung volum even in patient with sever airway obstruct show that time constant of empti vari wide in these patient it wa conclud that deterior of lung function in cystic fibrosi involv more than airway obstruct and that the worsen ga trap is explain by a progress loss of lung elast recoil
