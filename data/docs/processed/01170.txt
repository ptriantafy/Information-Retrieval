the local immun statu in cystic fibrosi we focus our studi on concentr of immunoglobulin lysozym lactoferrin some antiproteolyt fraction and acut phase protein in bronchial secret of children with variou pulmonari diseas especi with cystic fibrosi secretori iga is decreas in all studi group of patient have chronic or recurr infect of the respiratori tract when compar to the group of healthi children group which were character by the infect of the lower part of the respiratori tract had increas lysozym level the result obtain in the group of cf children are similar to those obtain in group with bronchiectasi and chronic bronchiti which suggest that the observ differ are characterist for chronic infect rather than for cf although in cf as well as in bronchiectasi massiv bacteri infect result in increas concentr of immunoglobulin antiproteolyt fraction and acut phase protein the result seen in both group are somewhat differ these differ may indic some differ in the reactiv to infect of the respiratori tract in cf in comparison to patient with bronchiectasi it seem conceiv that among children with cf who have veri low siga chronic respiratori tract infect occur earlier and igg respons to perman exposit to varieti of antigen is less vigor the present result rais also a possibl that the bacteri infect in cf doe not stimul defenc mechan to the same extent as in bronchiectasi
