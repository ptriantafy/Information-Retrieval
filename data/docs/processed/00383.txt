mucociliari transport in trachea of patient with cystic fibrosi mucociliari tracheal transport rate were measur in 20 patient with cystic fibrosi in whom these rate rang from 0 to 128 mmmin the patient were divid into 3 roughli equal group on the basi of their transport rate 1 those in whom no abnorm in mucociliari transport wa detect in the trachea 2 those in whom normal transport rate were measur but in whom abnorm such as cessat or revers of bolu movement were observ 3 those in whom no normal transport rate were observ in the first group the rate were similar to those observ in a popul of healthi adult these normal rate were observ in some patient who had a product cough the mean mucociliari tracheal transport rate increas with increas maximum midexpiratori flow those patient with a low shwachman score and poor arteri oxygen tension tend to fall into group 2 and 3 in the ciliari dyskinesia assay in rabbit trachea the serum from the patient with the higher transport rate tend to initi more rapid discharg of materi from the epithelium and ciliari dyskinesia
