mucos enterokinas activ in pancreat insuffici and celiac diseas jejun biopsi specimen were obtain from children with cystic fibrosi cf celiac diseas cd or congenit exocrin pancreat hypoplasia ceph and from control subject section were examin histolog and homogen were use for measur of enterokinas and sucras activ thi work wa undertaken becaus enterokinas is consid a brush border enzym the releas of which into the intestin lumen is influenc by pancreat enzym and also becaus we have recent shown a small bowel mucos dysfunct in patient with cf as expect sucras activ wa reduc p 05 in children with cd as compar to the other three group on the other hand enterokinas activ in children with pancreat insuffici cf and ceph wa higher p 05 than that of control subject the present studi ha shown that in patient with cf and ceph mucos enterokinas activ wa increas as compar to control subject it seem that the pancreat enzym play a larg role in the turnov of enzym in the brush border membran and that the observ increas of mucos enterokinas activ is probabl explain by a reduc degrad in patient with exocrin pancreat insuffici
