standard of a new minor salivari gland collect procedur for the diagnosi of cystic fibrosi the object of thi investig wa to further refin a techniqu develop to serv as a new test procedur for the diagnosi of cystic fibrosi of the pancrea util a more quantit approach for measur in a standard fashion the volum of secret of the minor salivari gland of the lower labial mucosa which can be collect over a fix period of time it wa also hope that such standard would facilit the more accur studi of all aspect of studi of minor salivari gland secret collect in thi fashion from the find it is obviou that less minor salivari gland secret wa collect from cystic fibrosi patient than from normal control subject use a capillari tube test thi may be due in part to an increas viscos of minorsalivarygland saliva in cystic fibrosi unfortun viscos studi were beyond the scope of thi investig the result indic that the rel differ between the volum of minor salivari secret collect at a standard test site and that collect over the total lower labial mucosa are similar the volumetr differ in minor salivari secret have again been found to be distinct enough to suggest that studi be continu in thi area to further refin a diagnost test procedur for cystic fibrosi of the pancrea at the present time studi are in progress to measur the volum of minor salivari secret at a standard test site employ an electron techniqu it is hope that thi approach may permit the elimin of viscos as a variabl
