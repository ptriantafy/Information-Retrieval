detect of cystic fibrosi protein by electrofocus detect of cystic fibrosi protein cfp use out method involv rather exact requir for the collect of serum sampl and their subsequ analysi by electrofocus minor variat in the method describ for sampl collect and storag may caus degrad and loss of cfp and thi by itself could lead to erron result sinc mani cf sampl would appear to be cfp neg make it imposs to observ a consist differ between a group of cf sampl and normal control sampl by electrofocus from the result present by thoma et al and figur 1 of the letter by smith et al it is obviou that neither group ha reproduc the protein handl pattern present in either of our previou report the ph gradient are not the same the locat of the sampl pad rel to the anod are not the same and the protein band pattern are total differ we question the valid of the techniqu use claim of have reproduc our method for detect cfp or suppos improv design to enhanc the detect of cfp
