immunochem studi of the plasma and cultur fibroblast media fraction contain the cystic fibrosi ciliari inhibitor the cystic fibrosi ciliari inhibitor cfci ha been fraction from plasma of cystic fibrosi cf homozygot and from the media of cultur fibroblast deriv from cf homozygot plasma and fibroblast media from normal control have been fraction in an ident manner fraction from plasma and fibroblast cultur media that demonstr ciliari inhibitori activ contain sever protein in a molecular weight rang of approxim 500011000 these protein have been partial character by immunochem analysi with antisera to 33 human serum protein immunolog determin of albumin c3 but not c3a c4 c5 alpha1lipoprotein beta lipoprotein beta2microglobulin and immunoglobulin light chain have been detect by hemagglutin in fraction of cf plasma that inhibit ciliari activ and in analog fraction from normal sera none of the protein were detect in media of cultur fibroblast from either genotyp sinc the same protein and protein fragment were identifi in both cf and normal plasma fraction and were not detect in cf fibroblast media it appear that none of these protein can be identifi as the cfci identif of these protein will permit further purif of the cfci by immunochem method
