improv method for detect of cystic fibrosi protein in serum use the lkb multiphor electrofocus apparatu we have develop an improv method for the detect of cystic fibrosi protein cfp the method employ the lkb multiphor to electrofocu whole serum instead of the apparatu use in previou studi two basic modif were necessari 1 a ph 25100 gradient instead of a ph 510 gradient and 2 constant power for focus the serum protein instead of constant voltag the first modif ensur adequ dissolut of the cfpigg complex or other precursor complex which may liber cfp the second modif ensur a linear gradient between ph 38 and ph 92 excel resolut in the ph 89 region and the separ of cfp within 2 hr without overh of the gel electrofocus with the lkb multiphor permit the detect of cfp in as mani as 24 serum sampl per gel result obtain from the analysi of 31 cystic fibrosi 28 oblig heterozygot carrier and 28 normal control sera indic that cfp can be reproduc and accur detect in sera use the lkb multiphor
