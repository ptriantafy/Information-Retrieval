carboxypeptidase activity cultured skin fibroblast relationship cystic fibrosis property carboxypeptidase cultured skin fibroblast control cystic fibrosis patient studied using alphan carbobenzoxylglutamylltyrosine substrate carboxypeptidase inhibited thiomersal cyanide iodoacetate n ethylmaleimide similar manner control cystic fibrosis fibroblast trypsin dithiothreitol treatment activated enzyme 110phenanthroline inhibited presence dithiothreitol zn2 co2 reversed inhibition trypsin treatment carboxypeptidase produced form enzyme higher km value control cystic fibrosis fibroblast dithiothreitol treatment control fibroblast resulted form similar property trypsin activated form cystic fibrosis fibroblast yielded variant form even higher km vmax value since property similar seems likely difference reflected binding molecule enzyme rather defect enzyme
