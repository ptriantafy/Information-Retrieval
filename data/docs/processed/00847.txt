carboxypeptidas a activ of cultur skin fibroblast and relationship to cystic fibrosi properti of carboxypeptidas a of cultur skin fibroblast from control and cystic fibrosi patient were studi use alphan carbobenzoxylglutamylltyrosin as substrat carboxypeptidas a wa inhibit by thiomers cyanid iodoacet and n ethylmaleimid in a similar manner for control and cystic fibrosi fibroblast both trypsin and dithiothreitol treatment activ the enzym but 110phenanthrolin inhibit onli in the presenc of dithiothreitol both zn2 and co2 revers thi inhibit trypsin treatment of carboxypeptidas a produc a form of the enzym have a higher km valu for both control and cystic fibrosi fibroblast dithiothreitol treatment of control fibroblast result in a form with similar properti to the trypsin activ form but cystic fibrosi fibroblast yield a variant form with even higher km and vmax valu sinc other properti were similar it seem like that thi differ reflect bind of a molecul to the enzym rather than of a defect in the enzym
