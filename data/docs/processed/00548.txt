abnorm level of 35cyclic amp in isoproterenolstimul fibroblast from patient with cystic fibrosi to determin if the abnorm of exocrin secret characterist of cystic fibrosi could be investig in vitro i studi the synthesi of 35cyclic amp after isoproterenol stimul in skin fibroblast deriv from patient with cystic fibrosi and from normal individu comparison of normal and cystic fibrosi cell show that the latter had 2 to 5fold greater level of intracellular cyclic amp after stimul with isoproterenol the differ between the strain wa observ at everi stage of the cultur cycl and wa specif to stimul by betaadrenerg agonist it could not be account for by differ dose or time respons curv nor by leakag of cyclic amp into the medium the increas sensit to catecholamin may reflect an intrins genet properti of cystic fibrosi cell and it may be feasibl to use thi system to studi the biochem basi of the genet defect in cystic fibrosi
