distribut of spermidin and spermin in blood from cystic fibrosi patient and control subject previou studi have shown an abnorm of the spermidineto spermin spdspm ratio in whole blood of cystic fibrosi homoand heterozygot to investig spd and spm distribut amoung blood compon as a possibl caus of the abnorm blood wa fraction use rabinowitz glass bead techniqu and boyum ficollhypaqu method free unconjug polyamin were extract with perchlor acid and quantit on an amino acid analyz in control mean sem concentr in nmoles109 cell of spd and spm respect were 102 008 and 0894 028 for erythrocyt 126 31 and 357 105 for lymphocyt 36 16 and 240 33 for granulocyt and less than 05 and less than 05 nmolesml for plasma when convert to the concentr in whole blood it wa found that greater than 90 of spd and over 70 of spm wa associ with erythrocyt while the higher cellular concentr in leukocyt wa not unexpect the fact that spd and spm in whole blood were primarili associ with erythrocyt wa a new find comparison with control reveal that the spdspm ratio in both whole blood and erythrocyt wa significantli higher in the group of cystic fibrosi patient
