the glycoproteindegrad potenti of peripher leukocyt in cystic fibrosi in thi studi the potenti problem and discrep in cill cultur techniqu were avoid by isol leukocyt from the peripher blood of patient with cystic fibrosi and healthi human volunt and prepar homogen to determin the specif activ of 5 lysosom enzym involv in the degrad of glycoprotein four lysosom hydrolas involv in the breakdown of the carbohydr side chain were assay use artifici substrat the fifth enzym aspartylglucosamin amido hydrolas which cleav the linkag between thi side chain and the peptid backbon wa assay with natur substrat no differ in enzym activ between the 2 leukocyt sourc were observ becaus no enzym activ were defici and no compensatori increas were note we conclud that the thick glycoproteinrich exocrin secret in cystic fibrosi cannot be attribut to a defect in their catabol
