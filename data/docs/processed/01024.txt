inhibit of tammhorsfal glycoprotein induct of alkalin phosphatas in cystic fibrosi fibroblast by medium condit by normal cell it is confirm that the level of alkalin phosphatas in fibroblast deriv from cystic fibrosi patient can be induc manyfold by grow the cell in the presenc of tammhorsfal glycoprotein it is further shown that normal fibroblast produc a cf correct factor which markedli inhibit thi phenomenon these observ support a previou hypothesi on the natur of the metabol defect in cystic fibrosi
