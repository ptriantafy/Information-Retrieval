studi on cystic fibrosi use isoelectr focus i an assay for detect of cystic fibrosi homozygot and heterozygot carrier from serum we have develop a standard biophys assay for the rapid detect of individu homozyg or heterozyg for cystic fibrosi cf the assay employ isoelectr focus in thin layer polyacrylamid gel to analyz microlit quantiti of whole serum for the presenc of a cf factor protein and for delet in a group of protein call protein b c and d fig 1 a ph 510 gradient is use fig 2 and each sampl is screen use a serum volum which contain 300 g immunoglobulin g igg individu homozyg or heterozyg for cf are distinguish from normal unaffect individu on the basi of the presenc of a cf factor protein band tabl 1 heterozyg carrier for cf are distinguish from cf homozygot 75 percent of the time on the basi of a delet in either band b c or d tabl 2 on the basi of screen 65 patient with cystic fibrosi 61 heterozyg carrier for cf and 105 normal control subject it wa conclud that no obviou correl exist between either sex age or sever of the diseas in the individu cf patient and the absolut presenc or absenc of the cf factor in addit no correl exist between sex or age and the presenc of the cf factor or delet in protein b c and d in the individu heterozyg carrier for cf or normal control subject analysi of serum sampl from 68 patient with a varieti of other diseas mani with clinic symptom resembl those seen in the patient with cystic fibrosi tabl 3 indic that the cf factor protein describ in thi studi appear to be diagnost for cf genotyp with the possibl except of patient with certain type of leukemia
