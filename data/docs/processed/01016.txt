intestin bile salt in cystic fibrosi studi in the patient and experiment anim the quantit and qualit distribut of bile salt in the duoden juic of 13 patient with cystic fibrosi cf wa studi after a test meal the effect of triolein to bovin serum albumin bsa and ricinol acid ra on the absorpt of taurochol tca in the distal ileum of the rat in vivo wa also studi the mean and rang of total bile salt concentr glycin taurin conjug ratio and percentag of dihydroxi bile salt in the patient with cf and pancreat insuffici were 35 1366 mmoll 86 greater than 1031 and 37 1060 compar with control valu of 74 30160 mmoll 30 1345 and 61 52 70 respect the differ between the control and cf valu were statist signific p less than 001p less than 0001 three of the 13 cf patient had total bile salt concentr less than 2 mmoll 8 had much higher glycin taurin ratio and 8 had a reduc percentag of dihydroxi bile salt in 2 patient with normal pancreat enzym activ duoden bile salt were both quantit and qualit normal to 10 and 30 mmoll bsa 3 and ra 5 mmoll had no inhibitori effect on the ileal absorpt of tca these result show pronounc abnorm of duoden juic bile salt in cf with pancreat insuffici consist with a broken enterohepat circul ehc such abnorm may contribut to defect lipid absorpt in cf the data in the experiment anim do not support the suggest that unhydrolys dietari substrat play a role in the pathophysiolog of the broken ehc
