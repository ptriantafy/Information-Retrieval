relationship of arterialalveolar nitrogen tension to alveolararteri oxygen tension lung volum flow measur and diffus capac in cystic fibrosi pulmonari function in children with cystic fibrosi wa assess by the arterialalveolar pn2 differ adjust to sublingu temperatur the result valu were compar with the alveolar arteri po2 differ arteri pco2 and standard measur of lung volum flow and diffus capac the arterialalveolar pn2 differ wa nearli one half of the po2 differ both earli in the diseas and at a more advanc stage analysi take into account the o2 dissoci curv and the possibl that alveolar temperatur is higher than sublingu temperatur suggest that all of the po2 differ could be explain in term of ventil perfus imbal in gasfil unit of the lung reduct of fraction co uptak with increas pn2 differ suggest that the decreas in diffus capac in cystic fibrosi may be explain by ventilationperfus inequ a signific relationship between arteri pco2 and the pn2 differ support the view that ventilationperfus inequ is the caus of co2 retent when present the pn2 and po2 differ were abnorm befor the standard test of lung volum and flow but in gener the correl wa excel becaus the pn2 differ wa not superior to the po2 differ in detect earli diseas and becaus the technic problem in it measur are consider it is not recommend as a routin measur
