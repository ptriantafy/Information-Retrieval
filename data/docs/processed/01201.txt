alter intracellular calcium in fibroblast from patient with cystic fibrosi and heterozygot the import of intracellular calcium ca in secret and transmembran ion movement led us to studi ca in cell from patient with cystic fibrosi cf which is a lethal genet exocrinopathi skin fibroblast from patient with cf oblig heterozygot hz and age and sexmatch control c were use in match pair experi measur 45ca exchang into and efflux from the cell over time cf cell line and hz cell line exhibit increas 45ca exchang when compar with their respect control p less than 0005 the magnitud of thi differ approxim 30 is not reduc when cell are wash with lanthanum chlorid after the exchang period thi differ is like attribut to an alter capac of one or more of the intracellular ca sequest organel further evid for thi explan wa seen in 45ca efflux experi in which cf cell retain a higher percent of their initi 0time 45ca than did c cell late in the efflux period p less than 005 the find of an alter ca pool size in both cf and particularli hz cell suggest that alter ca metabol is relat to the basic gene defect in cf
