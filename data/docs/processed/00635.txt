differenti serum amylas determin by use of an inhibitor and design of a routin procedur we describ a new method for measur pancreat and salivarytyp amylas in serum that requir no electrophoresi or chromatographi an inhibitor protein from wheat with a 100fold greater specif for human salivari than for human pancreat amylas wa use to analyz mixtur of the two enzym the concentr of pancreat and salivari amyalas wa determin in 141 normal sera 72 men and 69 women statist signific differ were found for serum pancreat amylas between mean and women higher valu be shown in women no sexrel differ wa found for the salivari compon of serum amylas with thi method the increas in serum amylas activ in pancreat wa shown to be attribut to the pancreat compon in mump the increas is attribut to the salivari compon in pancreat insuffici serum pancreat amylas activ were significantli lower than in the control our method is simpl and rapid our result agre well with those of other author who use chromatograph or electrophoret method
