kill of fibroblast by dexamethason or dibutyryl adenosin 35monophosph is not a valid test for cystic fibrosi assay base on the count of total cell and of colonyform cell were use to demonstr that neither dexamethason nor dibutyryl adenosin 35monophosph cyclic amp kill human fibroblast under a varieti of condit these result contradict those of previou studi show that dexamethason and dibutyryl cyclic amp kill a higher percentag of fibroblast from normal human than from individu with cystic fibrosi
