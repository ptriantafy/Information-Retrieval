echocardiograph profil of the longterm cardiac chang in cystic fibrosi in thi echocardiograph studi assess of the heart in children with cystic fibrosi ha shown that chang occur in not onli the right ventricl but also in the left ventricl and aorta as compar with normal echocardiogram could be success perform in 34 of 37 patient the thick of the right ventricular anterior wall and the dimens of the right ventricular caviti were abnorm even in patient with mild diseas nation institut of health nih score for sever of diseas of 85 or greater larger older children with lower nih score had disproportion larger right ventricular anterior wall and caviti the thick of the septal wall the thick of the left ventricular posterior wall and the aortic dimens were increas in those with sever diseas the dimens of the left ventricular caviti for the popul were slightli but significantli smaller than normal in systol and in diastol throughout the cours of the diseas thi studi demonstr that echocardiographi is an effect noninvas mean of assess the longterm chang in children with cystic fibrosi these chang occur in both side of the heart and appear to worsen as the diseas progress
