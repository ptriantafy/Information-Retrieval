detect of cystic fibrosi homozygot and heterozygot with plasma letter dr hosli and esther vogt base their diagnosi of heterozygot and homozygot for cystic fibrosi on the thermal stabil in plasma or extracellular fluid of alphamannosidas andor phosphatas activ assay at ph 54 the activ of alphamannosidas in plasma and thi ph is a composit one both acid alphamannosidas which ha a ph optimum of 425 and intermedi alphamannosidas which ha a ph optimum of 56 60 will contribut to the activ measur at ph 54 these two form of alphamannosidas are structur and genet distinct and have differ kinet and thermost therefor the total alphamannosidas activ at ph 54 and the physicochem properti of thi activ will depend upon the rel proport of the two type of alphamannosidas in the sampl the proport of the two form vari wide in normal plasma especi in plasma from children although the data of hosli and vogt suggest that the total alphamannosidas at ph 54 doe not differ significantli between control cf heterozygot and cf homozygot they do not show whether the proport of acid and intermedi alphamannosidas have chang an increas in the proport of the thermolabil intermedi alphamannosidas in cf would be manifest as a decreas thermost of alphamannosidas at ph 54 altern a mutat in the normal stabl acid alphamannosidas lead to a less stabl form would also be reflect as a decreas stabil in the activ at ph 54 especi if the proport of acid alphamannosidas wa increas in cf these situat should also be consid as possibl explan of the observ in addit to the one favour by hosli and vogt
