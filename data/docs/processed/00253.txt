concentr of gentamicin in bronchial secret of children with cystic fibrosi of tracheostomi comparison between the intramuscular rout the endotrach instil and aerosol the level of gentamicin in blood and in secret of the tracheobronchi tree were measur in 14 children 8 with cystic fibrosi and 6 with tracheostomi in a cross over fashion after the administr of 40 mg of gentamicin by aerosol or by endotrach inject high level of gentamicin greater than 20 mugml within the bronchial secret were observ in 7 children after aerosol and in 11 children after endotrach instil correspond blood level were low less than 3 mugml in all patient and no detect level were found in 10 children after aerosol and in 6 children after endotrach instil no signific differ were observ between children with cystic fibrosi and those with tracheostomi sinc intramuscular inject of gentamicin a singl dose of 15 mgkg result in low level of gentamicin within the bronchial secret less than 2 mugml in 10 patient among whom 4 had undetect level it is conclud that the administr of an antibiot such as gentamicin directli to the trachea by endotrach inject or by aerosol might prove to be help when the infect is confin mainli to the tracheobronchi tree
