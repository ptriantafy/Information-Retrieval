glycosyl of vsv glycoprotein is similar in cystic fibrosi heterozyg carrier and normal human fibroblast the singl envelop glycoprotein of vesicular stomat viru wa use as a specif probe of glycosyltransferas activ in fibroblast from two cystic fibrosi patient an oblig heterozyg carrier and a normal individu gel filtrat of pronasedigest glycopeptid from both purifi virion and infect cellassoci vsv glycoprotein which had been label with3h glucosamin did not reveal ani signific differ in the glycosyl pattern between the differ cell cultur all 4 cell line were appar abl to synthes the mannos and glucosamin contain core structur and branch chain termin in sialic acid which are characterist of asparaginelink carbohydr side chain in cellular glycoprotein analysi of tryptic glycopeptid by anionexchang chromotographi indic that the same 2 major site on the viru polypeptid were recogn and glycosyl in all 4 vsvinfect cell cultur these studi suggest that the basic biochem defect in cystic fibrosi is not an absenc or defici in enzym respons for the biosynthesi of complex carbohydr side chain
