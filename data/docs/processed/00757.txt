hemoglobinoxygen equilibrium in cystic fibrosi a studi of 35 patient with cystic fibrosi demonstr that increas sever of pulmonari involv wa associ with a mild but definit increas in erythrocyt 23diphosphoglycer 23 dpg and a decreas in hemoglobin affin for oxygen the predomin regul of 23dpg were blood ph cardiac output and system oxygen transport no signific relationship wa observ between erythrocyt 23dpg content and arteri oxygen tension hypophosphatemia may have prevent a greater increas in erythrocyt 23dpg content the inadequ increas in 23dpg and consequ insuffici chang in hemoglobinoxygen affin coupl with an insuffici compensatori erythrocyt respons may advers affect tissu oxygen in patient with sever cystic fibrosi
