methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzo reactiv proteas in amniot fluid possibl marker for cystic fibrosi letter previou studi in our laboratori have demonstr signific differ in the extent of proteas reactiv with mugb 4methylumbelliferyl guanidinobenzo a sensit activ site titrant of mani serin proteas when plasma and cultiv skin fibroblast from patient with cystic fibrosi cf oblig heterozygot and control were compar becaus of these observ and the potenti valu of amniot fluid for the prenat detect of cystic fibrosi these studi were extend to human amniot fluid obtain by amniocentesi done for the intrauterin detect of genet and other fetal abnorm an amnioticfluid sampl obtain from a woman who wa subsequ deliv of a babi with cf show a much reduc level of mugb reactiv similar to the rel defici observ in plasma and cultiv skin fibroblast from patient with cf these observ suggest that amnioticfluid proteas activ may be a use marker for the prenat detect of cf
