a simpl method for estim a heparin bind capac of human serum a method for estim a heparin bind capac of human serum is describ when human serum is dilut with a low ionic strength heparincontain buffer at ph 55 proteinheparin electrostat complex form in solut with subsequ format of insolubl aggreg which can be collect by centrifug quantit determin of the rel amount by weight of protein and heparin in the insolubl heparinprotein aggreg permit estim of a combin ratio at which serum protein bind with heparin to precipit from solut thi weight combin ratio of protein and heparin is a quantit measur of the total affin for heparin of all protein in serum which bind heparin at ph 557 to form an insolubl complex an unusu high affin for heparin by an abnorm serum protein or an increas in amount of a normal occur high heparinaffin serum protein would alter the averag protein heparin combin ratio and increas the heparin bind capac of human serum the convers would be true for serum protein have a low affin for heparin lower the heparinbind capac of human serum the describ method wa use to evalu the heparinbind capac of serum protein in normal individu and in person with cystic fibrosi
