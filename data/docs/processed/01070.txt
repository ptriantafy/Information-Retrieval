proteas defici in plasma of patient with cystic fibrosi reduc reaction of 4methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzo with plasma of patient with cystic fibrosi proteas activ in plasma is assay use 4 methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzo the assay is modifi by carri out the reaction in the presenc and absenc of benzamidin a competit inhibitor of trypsinlik proteas the paramet of the assay are describ in detail use thi assay our earlier demonstr of a defici of proteas activ in plasma of patient with cystic fibrosi is confirm the activ correct for the nonspecif hydrolysi of 4 methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzo by benzamidin is express as nanomol of 4methylumbelliferon releas per millilit plasma under standard condit the activ in plasma activ with chloroformellag acid wa 1272 231 in 7 control 704 117 in 11 oblig heterozygot and 487 166 in 12 patient with cystic fibrosi ident result were obtain when unactiv plasma wa use these data demonstr that the judici use of specif inhibitor such as benzamidin might be use in assay low level of proteas activ in crude system
