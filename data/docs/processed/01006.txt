maxim expiratori flow after postur drainag flow measur from maxim expiratori flowvolum mefv curv were use to evalu the efficaci of postur drainag in improv ventilatori function acut maxim expiratori flowvolum curv were obtain for 9 cystic fibrosi subject and 10 subject with chronic bronchiti befor and 5 15 and 45 min after a 30min session of postur drainag with percuss vibrat and cough forc vital capac fvc wa significantli increas 45 min after drainag for the combin group flow at high lung volum were differ for the 2 subgroup subject with cystic fibrosi demonstr a signific increas in peak expiratori flow rate 45 min after drainag and an increas in forc expiratori volum in one sec at all time interv the subject with chronic bronchiti had a decreas peak expiratori flow rate 5 min after drainag but by 45 min it had return to baselin there wa no signific chang in onesec forc expiratori volum at ani time interv for the chronic bronchiti subgroup chang in flow at low lung volum were similar for the 2 subgroup fortyf min after drainag there wa an increas in flow rate near 50 per cent of fvc flow near 25 per cent of fvc were increas 15 and 45 min after drainag thi studi demonstr that postur drainag with cough result in signific improv in flow at low lung volum chang in flow at high lung volum were less consist
