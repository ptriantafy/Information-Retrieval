studi on the synthesi of plasma membran protein of fibroblast from patient with cystic fibrosi the characterist increas salin of sweat and other abnorm of exocrin secret in patient with cystic fibrosi cf suggest the possibl of a disturb function of the plasma membran in thi diseas sever line of evid indic that fibroblast express the presenc of the cf genotyp therefor these cell were use in an in vitro studi direct at determin whether the manifest of cf might be relat to an alter of one or more of the protein compon of the plasma membran in order to evalu the synthesi of these compon grow fibrosblast from patient with cf and normal subject were briefli expos to either 14c or 3hleucin their plasma membran were then isol and subject to analysi in a nondeterg acrylamid gel system coelectrophoresi of differenti label prepar reveal the absenc of a detect abnorm in the synthet rate of ani of the more than 30 resolv protein speci
