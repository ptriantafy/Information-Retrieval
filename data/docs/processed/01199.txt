chronic reserpin rat as a model for cystic fibrosi na transport inhibitori effect in submaxillari saliva the retrograd perfus assay in the rat parotid gland wa use to investig the effect of salivari secret from control and reserpinetr rat on na reabsorpt result demonstr that submaxillari saliva from the treat anim caus a 69 inhibit of na reabsorpt accompani by a 28 reduct in the volum of saliva secret and a 22 reduct in flow rate by contrast submaxillari saliva from control rat caus a 6 inhibit of na reabsorpt a 6 reduct in volum and a 5 reduct in flow rate parotid saliva from reserpinetr rat also inhibit na reabsorpt to the extent of 39 and caus a 38 reduct in volum and a 33 reduct in flow parotid saliva from control rat onli inhibit na reabsorpt to the extent of 27 and caus a 4 6 reduct in salivari volum and flow rate the inhibit of na reabsorpt and the reduct in salivari volum and flow rate caus by submaxillari saliva of reserpinetr rat were either abolish or significantli reduc when the saliva wa previous heat to 100 degre c frozen and then thaw or kept in glass tube at 4 degre c for 24 hr these result indic that saliva from reserpinetr rat have compar effect in thi assay system to those of saliva from cystic fibrosi cf patient and further support it use as an anim model for thi diseas
