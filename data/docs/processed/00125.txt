letter na transport defect in cystic fibrosi use the techniqu of 3houabain bind to isol cell quissel and pitot conclud that the nak atpas function normal in fibroblast from cystic fibrosi patient howev thi find may not be veri relev to the na transport defect occur in thi genet diseas the na transport abnorm in cystic fibrosi seem to be confin to exocrin gland it is unknown at present whether the defect resid in an activ or passiv transport step of the cation at least with isol sweat gland tissu and erythrocyt from cystic fibrosi patient nak atpas activ ha been found to be normal howev a decreas in the ethacryn acidsensit efflux a na exchang mechan ha been report in cystic fibrosi erythrocyt these find suggest that there is no fundament abnorm in the nak atpas enzym in the diseas but there may be a defect in an ethacryn acidsensit transport step therefor in order to obtain a better understand of the cation transport defect one should measur the bind of label ethacrynicacid rather than ouabain
