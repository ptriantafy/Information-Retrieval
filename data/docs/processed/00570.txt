introduct current investig and theori on the genet defect in cystic fibrosi recent research in cystic fibrosi ha suggest at least two theori regard the genet defect underli thi preval diseas that a mutant gene in cystic fibrosi genotyp is respons for the synthesi of an alter protein that interfer with membran transport and mucociliari activ and that a mutant gene in cystic fibrosi genotyp is respons for an enzym defici lead to the presenc of undegrad metabolit that interfer with membran transport circul factor in cystic fibrosi and their effect on membran transport and mucociliari system are discuss as are the search for an enzymat defici and investig of alter metabol pathway comparison of somat cell from cystic fibrosi and normal genotyp is also outlin
