distal splenorenal shunt decompression portal hypertension child cystic fibrosis apart sound physiologic basis distal splenorenal shunt compared portacaval shunt conventional central splenorenal shunt two important reason think use type shunt especially advantageous child portal hypertension secondary cystic fibrosis firstly thick fibrotic retroperitoneal area porta hepatis portacaval shunt constructed avoided make distal splenorenal shunt easier operation secondly notwithstanding relatively smallsized vessel wide anastomosis constructed high flow rate therefore minimal chance shunt thrombosis
