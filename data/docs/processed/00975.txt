the biochem basi of cystic fibrosi an hypothesi base upon the polyelectrolyt of mucu the evid show that the patholog of cystic fibrosi cf is relat to mucoid secret consequ the question of what govern the viscos of mucu is examin in detail it is gener agre that the mucin gel consist of polyanion glycoprotein and a hitherto unidentifi poli cation crosslink protein it is propos that larger amount of polyc increas viscos and in excess caus mucu to becom a polyc as these compound are known to inhibit the ductal reabsorpt of sodium the two princip aspect of the patholog of cf can be relat to the same mechan the mucu globul membran mgm ha been propos as the cross link protein
