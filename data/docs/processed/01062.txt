defici of serum carboxypeptidas blike anaphylatoxin inactiv carboxypeptidas n activ in sera from patient with cystic fibrosi serum from 95 patient with cystic fibrosi and 47 control subject without cystic fibrosi wa analyz for carboxypeptidas blike activ in the presenc of optim concentr of co2 ion hippurylllysin and serum fourteen of the cystic fibrosi patient had no steatorrhea and therefor minim pancreat dysfunct patient with cystic fibrosi and control were of compar age serum carboxypeptidas blike activ wa significantli decreas in cystic fibrosi patient includ cystic fibrosi patient without steatorrhea significantli low valu were found in both male and femal cystic fibrosi patient when compar with control of similar sex although valu were unaffect by age in the control popul valu in older patient with cystic fibrosi were significantli lower than valu in younger patient no correl wa obtain between serum carboxypeptidas blike activ and pulmonari or hepat function serum carboxypeptidas blike activ therefor fall with progress of the diseas and may limit the abil to degrad circul peptid in older patient with cystic fibrosi defici serum carboxypeptidas blike activ is less like howev to be a factor in the develop of the earli manifest of the diseas
