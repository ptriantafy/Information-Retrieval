serum pancreat isoamylas in the diagnosi of cystic fibrosi heterozygot a nonvalu test a group of 102 oblig heterozygot for the cystic fibrosi gene were examin for genet type of pancreat isoamylas as well as enzym activ of pancreat isoamylas salivari isoamylas and total amylas in serum the analysi wa perform use electrophoret separ for detect of the variou type of isoamylas and their rel activ wa determin by mean of densitometri the activ of salivari isoamylas and total amylas in serum show no signific differ between the cystic fibrosi heterozygot and a control group the frequenc of the variant gene for pancreat isoamylas wa also the same as in the control the mean valu for pancreat isoamylas wa slightli higher in the cystic fibrosi heterozygot than in the control group 005 greater than p greater than 002
