differ in the incorpor of thymidin into dna of normal and cystic fibrosi fibroblast in vitro although similar fraction of cell were in the s phase of the cell cycl normal human skin fibroblast were shown to incorpor more than twice the 3htdr into their dna in vitro than did cell obtain from individu with cystic fibrosi cf oblig heterozygot incorpor an intermedi amount of the dna precursor studi were initi to determin the basi of the differenti incorpor of 3htdr among the genotyp an analog of thymidin budr produc vari effect on the growth kinet of the three genotyp the growth of cell in budr result in a 50 increas in the popul doubl time of all three genotyp and caus the cell morpholog to chang from a spindl shape to one in which the cell becam broaden and flat with numer cytoplasm project extend for distanc of sever cell diamet the activ of thymidin kinas and the particip of the exogen and de novo pathway in the synthesi of tmp were found to be approxim the same in all three genotyp the data suggest that an alter in the transport of thymidin into the cell may account for the differ in tdr incorpor into dna and thi may be associ with other chang in cystic fibrosi that are appar membran associ
