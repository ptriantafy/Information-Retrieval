effect of calcium on intestin mucin implic for cystic fibrosi a major featur of the diseas cystic fibrosi is the excess concentr of mucu within duct and gland of mucousproduc organ some mucou secret also show an elev in calcium concentr use purifi rat intestin goblet cell mucin as a model mucin we have investig the effect of millimolar addit 125 mm of cacl2 on the physic properti of the mucin isoton of incub media wa preserv in order to mimic in vivo condit cacl2 815mm caus a 1533 decreas in viscos no chang in electrophoret mobil in acrylamid gel and a 2030 decreas in solubl of the mucin solubl chang were revers by the addit of edta 20 mm to incub insolubl wa also produc in incub of mucin with a mixtur of solubl intestin content nacl wash these find strongli suggest that the mucin becam smaller and more dens as calcium wa ad a process most probabl achiev by loss of intramolecular water
