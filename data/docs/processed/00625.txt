membran function in cystic fibrosi ii methionin transport in normal and cystic fibrosi fibroblast initi rate kinet of methionin transport time cours of accumul of methionin and efflux of accumul methionin were studi in three normal and four cf human diploid fibroblast strain the rang of appar km wa 127321 micromet for the cf strain and 183392 micromet for the normal strain the rang of appar vmax wa 669922 nmole mg1 min1 for the cf strain and 559787 nmole mg1 min1 for the normal strain the pattern of accumul and efflux are quit similar in all the strain studi except for wi38 which show somewhat higher efflux and lower accumul than for other there wa no signific differ in the kinet paramet of methionin transport between cf and normal skin fibroblast and methionin transport will not serv as a marker for cystic fibrosi in cultur fibroblast
