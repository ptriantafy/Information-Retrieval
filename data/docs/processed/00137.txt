standard assay for the sodium reabsorpt inhibitori effect and studi of it salivari gland distribut in patient with cystic fibrosi the retrograd perfus assay of mago for the sodium reabsorpt inhibitori effect in sweat and mix saliva from patient with cystic fibrosi cf wa modifi by 1 use the second parotid gland of the rat as a control 2 care control the quantiti of saliva perfus into the rat parotid gland so that the ratio of millilit perfus to gram dri gland weight fell between 18 and 28 and 3 report the inhibitori effect as percentag of inhibit of the rate of sodium reabsorpt rna in the perfus gland calcul from the differ between the rna in the two gland use thi modifi assay we were abl to confirm that signific differ exist in the percentag of inhibit of rna caus by cf and normal mix saliva 470 plu or minu 248 and 180 plu or minu 83 mean plu or minu sd in addit similar signific differ in the percentag of inhibit of rna by submandibular gland secret 397 plu or minu 135 and 160 plu or minu 118 sublingu gland secret 395 plu or minu 60 and 197 plu or minu 143 and submucos gland secret 340 plu or minu 117 and 217 plu or minu 127 between cf and normal subject were observ howev parotid gland secret from cf subject show no increas inhibitori effect 125 plu or minu 79 and 125 plu or minu 66 these find demonstr that the sodium reabsorpt inhibitori effect is produc by the secret from some but not all salivari gland of patient with cf
