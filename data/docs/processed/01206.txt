serum salivary amylase cystic fibrosis letter found cystic fibrosis cf patient pancreatic insufficiency pi statistically lower total serum amylase level normal subject value still within normal range although found absolute amount salivary amylase serum patient cf pi normal subject percent contribution considerably higher found pancreas contributed approximately 23 total serum amylase cf patient pi value similar 34 amount found kamaryt et al also found davidson et al cf patient without pi higher total serum amylase value normal subject thus feel davidson et al misinterpreted result previous study fact feel davidson et al essentially confirmed previous work suggesting cf patient pancreatic insufficiency increased salivary amylase reason yet unknown experience shown indeed pancreatic portion first increased decrease patient cf apparent normal pancreatic function progress time toward pancreatic insufficiency however change serum amylase value patient cf average due change pancreatic contribution serum expressed mean highly significantly different normal abnormal pancreatic function second important point paper mean variation occurred serum sample patient cf total amylase value within normal test range serum salivary isoamylase normal patient cf pi higher serum salivary percent
