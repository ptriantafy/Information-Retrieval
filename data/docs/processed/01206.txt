serum salivari amylas in cystic fibrosi letter we found that cystic fibrosi cf patient with pancreat insuffici pi had a statist lower total serum amylas level than normal subject but all valu were still within the normal rang although we found that the absolut amount of salivari amylas in the serum of patient with cf and pi wa the same as that for normal subject the percent of contribut wa consider higher we found that the pancrea contribut approxim 23 of the total serum amylas in cf patient with pi a valu veri similar to the 34 amount found by kamaryt et al we also found as did davidson et al that cf patient without pi had higher total serum amylas valu than did normal subject thu we feel that davidson et al have misinterpret the result of our previou studi and in fact we feel that davidson et al have essenti confirm our previou work by suggest that cf patient with pancreat insuffici have an increas salivari amylas for reason yet unknown our experi ha shown that inde the pancreat portion is first increas and then decreas as the patient with cf and appar normal pancreat function progress with time toward pancreat insuffici howev the chang in serum amylas valu in patient with cf are on the averag due to chang in the pancreat contribut to the serum and as express as a mean wa highli significantli differ for both normal and abnorm pancreat function the second import point of our paper wa that thi mean variat occur in serum sampl from patient with cf that had total amylas valu within the normal test rang the serum salivari isoamylas in both normal and patient with cf and pi had a higher serum salivari percent
