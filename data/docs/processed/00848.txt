urinary cyclic nucleotide adult male cystic fibrosis patient urinary adenosine 35 cyclic monophosphate guanosine 35 cyclicmonophosphate excretion significantly elevated adult male cystic fibrosis patient compared normal men value expressed way consider smaller size cystic fibrosis subject age cystic fibrosis patient excreted 322 116 nmol adenosine 35 cyclicmonophosphateg creatinine per 24 h v 197 043 normal men p le 002 cystic fibrosis patient excreted 050 016 nmol guanosine 3k cyclicmonophosphateg creatinine per 24 h v 030 007 normal men p le 005 subject adult completed linear growth sexual development thus eliminating possible effect slower maturation cystic fibrosis patient subject male thus avoiding fluctuation urinary cyclic nucleotide menstrual cycle problem complicated interpretation previous study
