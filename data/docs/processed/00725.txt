abnorm biliari lipid composit in cystic fibrosi effect of pancreat enzym becaus of the increas incid of gallston in cystic fibrosi we compar biliari lipid composit in 26 patient with cystic fibrosi seven children with cholelithiasi but no cysticfibrosi and 13 control eighteen of the cystic fibrosi group had cholecystogram and onli one had gallston in 14 patient with cystic fibrosi who had stop take pancreat enzym for one week molar percentag of lipid composit account for by cholesterol mean se 163 29 and satur index 20 03 were compar to valu of the cholelithiasi group and higher p less than 001 than those of control in 12 patient with cystic fibrosi take pancreat enzym molar percentag of cholesterol 86 17 and satur index 10 01 did not differ from those of control in cystic fibrosi there wa a preponder of cholic over chenodeoxychol acid both off 17 02 and on 19 03 therapi as compar to the cholelithiasi 07 01 and control 08 00 group the glycinetaurin ratio of conjug bile acid were lower in enzymetr patient with cystic fibrosi 37 06 than in patient off treatment 64 10 but wa higher p less than 001 than in control 18 02 bile is lithogen in untreat cystic fibrosi and respond to pancreat enzym
