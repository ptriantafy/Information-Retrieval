ventilatory muscle endurance training normal subject patient cystic fibrosis ventilatory muscle become fatigued contribute respiratory failure patient chronic obstructive lung disease may benefit improving ventilatory muscle endurance improve resistance fatigue ventilatory muscle endurance measured 30 normal subject 55 patient cystic fibrosis finding highest level normocapnic hyperpnea could sustained 15 min subject cystic fibrosis 36 per cent higher ventilatory muscle endurance normal subject reflecting chronic training stress breathing increased respiratory load four normal subject 4 subject cystic fibrosis participated specific ventilatory muscle endurance training program consisting 25 min per day maximal normocapnic hyperpnea 5 day per week 4 week cystic fibrosis patient trained improved ventilatory muscle endurance 516 per cent whereas normal subject trained showed 221 per cent increase ventilatory muscle endurance seven subject cystic fibrosis participated 4week physical activity training program consisting least 15 hour per day intensive swimming canoeing summer camp increased ventilatory muscle endurance 567 per cent pulmonary function change ventilatory muscle endurance readily improved cystic fibrosis equally well specific ventilatory muscle endurance exercise
