erythrocyt membran properti in cystic fibrosi the biochem properti of the erythrocyt membran have been studi in cystic fibrosi patient and in agematch control no signific differ could be observ in either the concentr or composit of the princip membran constitu contrari to previou report we found normal level of the mg2depend and ca2 mg2depend atpas activ in cf prepar howev a qualit differ wa observ in the ca2depend atpas sinc the enzym had rel greater activ at lower calcium concentr in the cystic prepar thi effect on the membranebound ca2atpas is unlik to repres a genet defect in the enzym itself but it may be connect with the mechan of pathogenesi in cystic fibrosi
