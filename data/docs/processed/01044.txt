lymphocyt acidhydrolas and respons to mitogen in cystic fibrosi in the present studi we compar the level of a seri of cultur lymphocyt acidhydrolas enzym in cystic fibrosi homozygot heterozygot and control compar the effect of three differ mitogen on these level and studi the effect of cf vs control serum in the cultur medium our observ provid an entir new interpret for the appar chang occur in lymphocyt enzym dure cultur of lymphocyt with mitogen and suggest that a serum factor is present in cystic fibrosi serum that mimic mitogen in thi regard lymphocyt acidhydrolas and total protein are present in higher concentr in lymphocyt cultur for 48 hour without mitogen when cf homozyg or heterozyg serum is present in the cultur media thi appear to result from a cf serum factor that ha mitogenlik activ and prevent loss of cell protein dure cultur respons of the cellular protein to mitogen is blunt when cf serum is present in the cultur media either becaus the cell protein are alreadi maxim stimul by the cf serum factor or the factor block or modifi the action of mitogen on lymphocyt protein content thi phenomenon is use for detect of cf heterozygos and appear to reflect the genet abnorm caus cystic fibrosi
