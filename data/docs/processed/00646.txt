cystic fibrosi studi with the oyster ciliari assay bioassay use ciliari system have detect a factor or factor in cystic fibrosi cf sera and tissu cultur medium deriv from cf cell the typic shortcom of an assay measur biolog activ have been studi and the mean to overcom the weak of the oyster gill cilia assay have been establish the presenc of the cystic fibrosi mucociliari inhibitor cfmi in experiment fraction may be determin by accept data from onli those assay in which authent cf and normal noncf fraction give defin reaction by measur the reaction of each sampl at least three time and by examin each experiment sampl at a protein concentr greater than the minimum establish in thi studi the rel concentr of the cfmi present in the first step of purif of serum and medium have been calcul in term of unit of inhibit gener the unit of inhibit present in serum and medium fraction from heterozygot are close to onehalf of that in fraction from homozyg sourc analog fraction concentr from a normal noncf sourc never inhibit mucociliari activ even when test at nearli 100 time the cf concentr ciliari assay util oyster gill are essenti for monitor fraction procedur aim at purifi the cfmi and have been shown to be capabl and reliabl enough to do so
