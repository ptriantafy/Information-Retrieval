arginin esteras in cystic fibrosi of the pancrea arginin esteras activ in chloroformellag acidtr plasma from 11 patient with cystic fibrosiscf and 12 agematch control subject ha been resolv into it compon fraction by ion exchang chromatographi on deaesephadex and electrofocus on polyacrylamid gel the activ can be resolv into two fraction by chromatographi one of which is inhibit by soybean trypsin inhibitor sti and the other of which is not inhibit by sti in plasma of cf patient the fraction of activ inhibit by sti is reduc to approxim 30 of the correspond fraction in control plasma in contrast the fraction of activ resist to inhibit by sti did not show ani signific quantit differ between control and cf plasma sampl analysi of plasma sampl by electrofocus on 5 polyacrylamid gel in the rang of ph 5080 and subsequ stain for arginin esteras activ show qualit differ between control and cf plasma sampl six activ band could be detect in control sampl wherea five band were detect in cf sampl eight sampl had one type of band miss two had anoth type of band miss and one had yet anoth type of band miss all of these band were restrict to a narrow ph zone in the center of the gel these data are consist with and extend our earlier report of differ in arginin esteras activ between plasma sampl of cf patient and control subject the demonstr of the absenc of a singl band of arginin esteras activ is consist with the absenc of a specif arginin esteras isoenzym in patient with cf the defici of arginin esteras in patient with cystic fibrosi may account for the presenc of factor in saliva plasma and fibroblast of these patient and consequ for the clinic manifest of the diseas
