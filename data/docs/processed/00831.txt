study meconium cystic fibrosis activity alphadmannosidase betaglucuronidase betadfucosidase acid alkaline phosphatase specific activity alphadmannosidase betaglucuronidase betadfucosidase acid alkaline phosphatase studied meconium infant cystic fibrosis cf control subject study revealed significant variation specific activity enzyme except acid phosphatase variation uniform activity alphadmannosidase betaglucuronidase alkaline phosphatase markedly decreased p le 0001 p le 0002 p le 0001 respectively activity betadfucosidase significantly increased p le 0001 meconium infant cf suggested decreased activity alphadmannosidase beta glucuronidase might contribute accumulation abnormal substance cf meconium highly increased activity betad fucosidase raise possibility additional alternative method screening newborn cf using meconium test material
