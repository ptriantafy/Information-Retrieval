mucoid pseudomona aeruginosa and cystic fibrosi resist of the mucoid from to carbenicillin flucloxacillin and tobramycin and the isol of mucoid variant in vitro mucoid strain of pseudomona aeruginosa isol from the sputa of patient with cystic fibrosi or in vitro through select with phage were more resist to carbenicillin flucloxacillin and tobramycin and more sensit to tetracyclin than relat nonmucoid strain the observ led to the develop of a techniqu for the isol of mucoid variant in vitro base on enhanc resist to carbenicillin mucoid variant were isol from variou strain of ps aeruginosa and the exopolysaccharid found to be similar to that obtain from mucoid ps aeruginosa isol from patient with cystic fibrosi
