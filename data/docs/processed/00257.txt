tropomyosin antibodi the specif local of tropomyosin in nonmuscl cell an antibodi against purifi chicken skelet muscl tropomyosin is use in indirect immunofluoresc to visual the local of tropomyosin in a varieti of nonmuscl cell the antibodi produc a fluoresc pattern which is veri similar to that obtain with an actinspecif antibodi thi pattern is compos of fluoresc fiber which are shown to be coincid with the fiber seen with phasecontrast optic high resolut epifluoresc microscopi reveal that fiber stain with the actin antibodi show a continu fluoresc while fiber react with the tropomyosin antibodi show a period fluoresc measur indic that the length of the fluoresc segment are variabl with an averag of 12 mum while the space between segment is approxim 04 mum
