the methyl of transfer and ribosom ribonucl acid in human fibroblast normal methyl of ribonucl acid in cystic fibrosi a comprehens studi of trna and 18 s and 28 s rrna methyl in human fibroblast is present cell from normal volunt and patient with cystic fibrosi cf were examin dure exponenti growth by incub with lmethyl14cmethionin and 3huridin the ratio of 14c to 3h count per minut in isol rna serv as a measur of the extent of methyl and wa found to be similar in normal and cf fibroblast for trna 18 s rrna and 28 s rrna hydrolyz sampl of 14cmethyllabel rna speci were analyz by two dimension chromatographi and autoradiographi the methyl base and nucleosid composit of trna and rrna agre well with data for hela cell and other eurkaryot cell such as those from yeast mous and chicken rna methyl pattern in cf fibroblast were qualit and quantit similar to those observ in normal cell for 4 s 18 s and 28 s rna there is no evid that rna speci from patient with cystic fibrosi are defici in ani methyl compon methyl of rna by tissuecultur cell from cystic fibrosi is qualit and quantit normal and will not prove to be a use marker for identif of carrier of cystic fibrosi
