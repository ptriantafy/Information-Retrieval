decreas ouabain bind in cystic fibrosi fibroblast in potassiumfre medium we have previous demonstr that cystic fibrosi cf cell show increas surviv compar to normal cell when expos to ouabain in medium lack potassium in thi report we show that the cf cell bind significantli less ouabain than the normal cell in potassiumdefici medium use agematch normal and cf skin fibroblast strain we show that 1 at ouabain concentr 20x109 m bind for both normal and cf cell is linear with time for 1 h and reach equilibrium after 4 h 2 at ouabain concentr between 2 and 20x109 m the initi rate of bind for cf cell is approx 70 of the normal cell 3 under equilibriumbind condit scatchard analysi reveal that three differ cf strain have 12 16 and 44 fewer ouabainbind site than their match normal control in addit studi in potassiumfre medium of the inhibit of 86rb flux a kplu analogu into the cell by ouabain show no differ between cf and normal cell we have also previous shown that in a low glucos potassiumdefici medium the cf cell surviv ouabain exposur no better than normal cell in thi report equilibriumbind studi with 3houabain clearli show that cf cell bind less ouabain under these condit than normal cell these result indic that ouabain resist in cf cell is not sole a function of differ in ouabain bind furthermor the differenti ouabain kill may not be due to ion transport differ but rather to as yet unknown mechan cf cell thu appear to be unlik previous character ouabainresist mutant
