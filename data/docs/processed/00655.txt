decreased ouabain binding cystic fibrosis fibroblast potassiumfree medium previously demonstrated cystic fibrosis cf cell show increased survival compared normal cell exposed ouabain medium lacking potassium report show cf cell bind significantly le ouabain normal cell potassiumdeficient medium using agematched normal cf skin fibroblast strain show 1 ouabain concentration 20x109 binding normal cf cell linear time 1 h reach equilibrium 4 h 2 ouabain concentration 2 20x109 initial rate binding cf cell approx 70 normal cell 3 equilibriumbinding condition scatchard analysis reveals three different cf strain 12 16 44 fewer ouabainbinding site matched normal control addition study potassiumfree medium inhibition 86rb flux kplus analogue cell ouabain show difference cf normal cell also previously shown low glucose potassiumdeficient medium cf cell survived ouabain exposure better normal cell report equilibriumbinding study 3houabain clearly show cf cell bind le ouabain condition normal cell result indicate ouabain resistance cf cell solely function difference ouabain binding furthermore differential ouabain killing may due ion transport difference rather yet unknown mechanism cf cell thus appear unlike previously characterized ouabainresistant mutant
