reaction 4methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate protease plasma patient cystic fibrosis protease activity assayed using 4 methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate active site titrant certain protease significantly deficient plasma patient cystic fibrosis deficiency demonstrated chloroformellagic acid activated plasma protease hydrolyze ester arginine unactivated plasma protease negligible activity towards ester deficiency also demonstrated separation protease isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel chromatography agarose columsn since protease deficiency demonstrated unactivated plasma deficiency cystic fibrosis probably due reduced number protease molecule rather decreased catalytic efficiency
