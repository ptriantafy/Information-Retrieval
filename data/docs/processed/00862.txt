reaction of 4methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzo with proteas in plasma of patient with cystic fibrosi proteas activ assay use 4 methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzo an activ site titrant of certain proteas is significantli defici in plasma of patient with cystic fibrosi the defici can be demonstr with both chloroformellag acid activ plasma in which the proteas can hydrolyz ester of arginin and unactiv plasma in which the proteas have neglig activ toward these ester the defici can also be demonstr by separ of the proteas by isoelectr focus on polyacrylamid gel or by chromatographi on agaros columsn sinc proteas defici can be demonstr with unactiv plasma the defici in cystic fibrosi is probabl due to a reduc number of proteas molecul rather than their decreas catalyt effici
