the signific of the sweat test in chronic pancreat in order to studi the disposit which is thought to be latent in chronic pancreat we investig the sweat chlorid concentr of 95 normal subject 43 case of chronic pancreat 12 case of cholelithiasi 15 case of peptic ulcer 16 case of hepat diseas and 23 case of diabet mellitu with the sweat test use the method of pilocarpin iontophoresi we obtain the follow result 1 in normal subject the sweat chlorid concentr wa inclin to rise gradual with age from childhood to adulthood the mean valu of sweat chlorid concentr wa 300 meqlit in adult from 20 year old and the upper limit wa about 60 meqlit 2 the mean valu of sweat chlorid concentr wa 600 meqlit in chronic calcifi pancreat thi valu wa markedli higher than that of control subject of the same age p is less than 0001 3 the mean valu of sweat chlorid concentr in cholelithiasi peptic ulcer and hepat diseas did not differ significantli from control subject the mean valu of sweat chlorid concentr in diabet mellitu wa significantli higher than that of control subject p is less than 001 but wa significantli lower than that in chronic pancreat p is less than 001 4 it wa suppos that some case of chronic pancreat have a congenit disposit toward abnorm secret of sweat gland and epithelium in the pancreat duct resembl cystic fibrosi and thi disposit lead easili to pancreat disord when the individu is expos to variou extern factor
