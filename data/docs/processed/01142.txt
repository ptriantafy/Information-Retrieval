differenti incorpor of 3hthymidin into dna in cultur skin fibroblast deriv from patient with cystic fibrosi and control tritiat thymidin 3htdr incorpor into dna of the fibroblast deriv from subject with cystic fibrosi cf and their control wa studi with scintil count and autoradiographi 3htdr incorpor at 24 hour postseed wa significantli less p 0005 in cf strain in comparison with cell from control the percentag of label fibroblast wa not significantli differ between the two strain p 01 the cell cycl time and the durat of each phase were studi by a mitot select and scintil count techniqu there wa no differ in cell cycl time between cf and control fibroblast howev the durat of the synthet phase wa significantli p 0005 longer in cf subject
