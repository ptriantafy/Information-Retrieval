solubl protein of bronchopulmonari secret from patient with cystic fibrosi asthma and bronchiti the concentr of nine plasma protein were determin by quantit immunoelectrophoresi in sputum specimen from 29 patient with cystic fibrosi cf and from 24 patient with sever asthma and chronic bronchiti the result suggest that the popul of cf patient could be divid into two group in spite of an absenc of differ in clinic statu between the group averag concentr of seven plasma protein in sputum of group i cf patient were ident with those in sputum of patient with bronchiti but the averag concentr of six of these protein in sputum from group ii cf patient were higher than those in specimen from the bronchit patient and were similar to correspond concentr in sputum from patient with asthma all of whom were examin while in statu asthmaticu the averag concentr of 14 secretori protein were the same in all sputum specimen whether or not they were produc by patient with cystic fibrosi asthma or bronchiti it wa conclud that the concentr in the bronchopulmonari secret of protein associ with host defenc were not diminish in patient with cystic fibrosi and failur to produc adequ concentr of protein with antimicrobi activ wa unlik to be respons for the abov averag suscept to chest infect in cystic fibrosi it is suggest that there exist a group of cf patient in whom a pulmonari allerg reaction gener an inflammatori respons as sever as that character statu asthmaticu and that thi respons could be detriment
