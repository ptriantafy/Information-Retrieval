the chronic ligat submandibular salivari duct of the rabbit as a possibl model for cystic fibrosi proceed schulz 1969 show that the rais na concentr in the sweat of children suffer from cystic fibrosi wa due to a defect in na reabsorpt in the duct epithelium but somewhat surprisingli the transepitheli potenti differ pd is the same as that in normal control na transport is also reduc in the chronic ligat salivari duct of the rabbit submandibular gland fraser smaje 1978 and becaus pd is unaffect the ligat gland may be a use model of thi aspect of cystic fibrosi here we would like to report a further similar to cystic fibrosi duct ligat lead to goblet cell hyperplasia which also occur in the salivari gland in cystic fibrosi lev spicer 1965 section of the salivari duct 6 microm thick were taken at 60 microm interv from duct which had been ligat for between 1 and 5 week and from their contralater control follow fixat by immers ligat result in an increas in lumin diamet by distens of the previous convolut epithelium but there wa no signific chang in epitheli surfac area the number of cell layer appear to have increas howev and there wa a prolifer of goblet cell the mucu in these cell wa stain by alcian blue at ph 1 indic the presenc of sulphomucin the mean goblet cell densiti rose from 762 plu or minu 473 mm2 mean plu or minu se of the mean n 6 in control to 114 plu or minu 496 in ligat duct the transepitheli na flux in the same duct wa reduc from 101 plu or minu 079 nmole cm2 sec1 to 16 plu or minu 084 while pd remain at 22 mv similar to those result previous report there wa no signific correl between the degre of diminut of na transport and the densiti of goblet cell but there wa a posit correl r 090 between the number of goblet cell in the control and contralater ligat duct
