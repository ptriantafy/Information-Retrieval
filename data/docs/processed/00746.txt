electrophoret analysi of serum protein in cystic fibrosi thi studi util isoelectr focus and electrophoresi in an attempt to detect a cystic fibrosi cf serum factor for which there is consider indirect evid the method of isoelectr focus in polyacrylamid gel iefag specifi by wilson et al 53 as reproduc in our laboratori did not enabl the detect of a cf factor protein report to focu near ph 8485 consequ we employ our modifi iefag techniqu which enabl us to demonstr significantli enhanc resolut and strike heterogen in serum gammglobulin despit the signific increas in the number of band resolv by our method neither a differ at ph 8485 nor other differ throughout the alkalin ph rang could be detect consist in the cf and heterozyg sera the twostep iefagdisc electrophoresi techniqu outlin by altland et al 2 as reproduc in our laboratori indic that at least one small cation protein could be fraction from all serum sampl improv in the method of disc electrophoresi result in the observ of numer band from some sampl and of differ among the sampl but no protein band uniqu to the cf genotyp wa observ our approach employ differ electrophoresi techniqu and vari the condit of sampl analysi should have increas the likelihood of detect a protein or protein specif for the cf genotyp despit the mani variat in our approach no consist uniqu protein wa observ in the cf or heterozyg sera a cf serum factor cannot be readili demonstr by the electrophoret techniqu describ the valu of the biophys assay and the nonbiolog techniqu report in the literatur is suspect and the promis and applic of these techniqu as diagnost test for the cf gene should be care evalu
