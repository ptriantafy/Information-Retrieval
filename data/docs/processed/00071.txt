studi of alpha1antitrypsin in amniot fluid meconium and cord serum of a homozygot newborn infant pp 10722 cord serum amniot fluid and meconium of a newborn from a heterozygot pizz mother were investig in the newborn infant the diagnosi of homozygot pizz defici of alpha1antitrypsin could be establish in cord serum at the time of deliveri trypsin inhibitori capac tic and alpha1antitrypsin at in cord serum were in the rang of adult homozygot by mean of cross immunoelectrophoresi exclus the phenotyp allel zz were demonstr thi exclud the possibl of maternofet transfer of alpha1antitrypsin in infant amniot fluid extrem low antiproteaseact and substanti no alpha1antitrypsin wa found wherea in normal sampl the tic is 3 to 6 of the cord serum valu and the at 12 to 4 of cord serum concentr our data suggest that a major compon of tic and at in normal amniot fluid deriv from the fetu in normal meconium we detect tic and at in concentr increas proport to the total protein content the inhibitori capac of at in meconium express in mg trypsin inhibit per mg alpha1antitrypsin howev is 80 less than serum alpha1antitrypsin no correl exist with the free tryptic activ of meconium the at of an pizz infant is clearli diminish when refer to fresh weight wherea meconia from three cystic fibrosi newborn screen by the bm test had extrem high concentr estim of tic and at in meconium is regard as a use approach for screen on homozygot alpha1antitrypsin defici the exact diagnosi howev can onli be establish by phenotyp the allel in cystic fibrosi the high protein content of meconium is accompani by increas alpha1antitrypsin level
