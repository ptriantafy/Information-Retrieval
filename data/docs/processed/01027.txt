differenti concanavalin a bind of cystic fibrosi and normal liver alphalfucosidas a novel techniqu ha been employ to demonstr that alphal fucosidas purifi from cystic fibrosi and control liver exhibit differenti bind to the lectin concanavalin a the concentr of alphach3mannosid necessari to prevent 50 bind of alphalfucosidas to concanavalin a is consider lower for the cystic fibrosi enzym 135 vs 333 mm compar result were found when bind studi were done on crude supernat alphalfucosidas from 8 cystic fibrosi and 8 control liver 56 plu or minu 04 mm and 132 plu or minu 34 respect without ani overlap of valu between the cystic fibrosi and control liver these result suggest that compar lectin bind studi on cystic fibrosi and normal glycoprotein from readili avail tissu might result in an assay for detect the cystic fibrosi genotyp
