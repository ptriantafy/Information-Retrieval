cystic fibrosis heterozygote detection study normal population detection cystic fibrosis cf heterozygote testing cystic fibrosis factor activity cffa serum sample using bioassay reported give unreliable result present study undertaken find whether use medium short term white blood cell skin fibroblast culture rather serum test sample would eliminate inconsistency short term white blood cell culture established 107 normal healthy individual culture 97 cffa six 16 showed variable result four 710 activity four test done single sample assay repeated 3 month later new culture four positive cffa individual two showed activity no 7 9 two no 8 10 10 individual whose culture showed cffa history allergy association cffa culture medium derived individual allergy intermittent presence activity suggested environmental factor induced cfflike activity white blood cell culture oyster ciliary assay using medium white blood cell culture cannot used screening cf heterozygote since substitution culture medium serum eliminate inconsistent result cffa specific assay cf gene fibroblast line established four person whose initial white blood cell culture consistently showed cffa one 7 showed cf culture phenotype cffa positive metachromasia
