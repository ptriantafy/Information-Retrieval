carboxypeptidas b activ of cultur skin fibroblast and relationship to cystic fibrosi enzym activ against hippuryllarginin wa studi in cultur skin fibroblast from control and cystic fibrosi patient the enzym had a lysosom distribut and an acid optimum of ph 45 with littl or no activ present abov ph 70 dithiothreitol wa requir for full activ and the kinet of thiol activ were differ for the control and cystic fibrosi enzym the properti and lysosom distribut of the enzym indic that it wa a carboxypeptidas b substrat affin thermol ph stabil the fall and rise in activ with subcultur the cyclic pattern of activ through serial passag and the level of activ were similar for the control and cystic fibrosi enzym
