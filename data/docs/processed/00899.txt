diagnosi of exocrin pancreat insuffici in cystic fibrosi by the synthet peptid nbenzoylltyrosylpaminobenzo acid the synthet peptid nbenzoylltyrosylpaminobenzo acid is specif cleav by chymotrypsin to bzti and paba the liber paba is absorb and excret in the urin accordingli paba recoveri reflect intralumin chymotrypsin activ and is an index of exocrin pancreat function thi test wa evalu in 24 patient with cystic fibrosi to determin it role in the diagnosi of exocrin pancreat insuffici cumul percent paba recoveri in six hour wa significantli lower in cf patient compar with the control group no overlap wa note between the two group there wa good correl between paba recoveri fecal chymotrypsin activ and coeffici of fat absorpt these find indic that paba recoveri is significantli reduc in patient with cf and steatorrhea and may prove a practic and reliabl test of pancreat insuffici
