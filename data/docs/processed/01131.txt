screening cystic fibrosis letter cysticfibrosis child usually either severe lung disease mild steatorrhea severe maldigestion lesser pulmonary problem therefore measured serumproteases cysticfibrosis patient control see support following hypothesis since lack antitrypsin associated lung damage plasmatrypsin excess antitrypsin might responsible lung damage cystic fibrosis general protease trypsin level measured spectrophotometrically using modification method erlanger kojowsky cohen result showed significant difference protease trypsin level cysticfibrosis patient control difference result crossley et al may explained differing measuring technique used trypsin level measured spectrophotometrically radioimmunoassay
