premature senescence cultured skin fibroblast subject cystic fibrosis cultured skin fibroblast subject cystic fibrosis exhibited normal population doubling time early passage 13 cumulative population doubling cystic fibrosis line doubled slowly control ceased doubling 19 weekly passage control line continued doubling 27 passage premature senescence noted cell subject cystic fibrosis reconciles controversial observation cell doubling reported literature data presented demonstrate experiment cystic fibrosis cell late passage may generate misleading result since difference control line may ascribed generalized senile change rather specific result cystic fibrosis genotype
