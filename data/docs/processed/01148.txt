alkalin phosphatas induct in cystic fibrosi fibroblast letter hosli ha publish a hypothesi relat to the primari caus of cystic fibrosi cf base on hi observ that the level of alkalin phosphatas alp in cfderiv skin fibroblast but not fibroblast deriv from normal individu could be increas severalfold by grow the cell in the presenc of the urinari glycoprotein tammhorsfal protein thp howev we have not been abl to show in adelaid ani chang or induct in the level of alp activ in cfderiv skin fibroblast when grown in the presenc of local prepar thp under what appear to be ident cell cultur condit to those use by hosli it thu appear that under the condit current employ in our laboratori there is no diagnost discrimin between fibroblast of cf homozygot and normal individu
