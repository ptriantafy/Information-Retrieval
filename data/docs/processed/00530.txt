studi on cystic fibrosi use isoelectr focus ii demonstr of defici proteolyt cleavag of alpha2macroglobulin in cystic fibrosi plasma a protein with an isoelectr point pi of 548 wa found to be defici in plasma from most cystic fibrosi cf homozygot and oblig heterozygot carrier of cf as compar with normal control plasma purif of the protein with a pi of 548 from normal plasma wa perform use ammonium sulfat precipit deae cellulos and cmcellulos chromatographi sephadex g200 gel filtrat starch block electrophoresi and sepharos 4b gel filtrat the purifi protein migrat as a singl band on polyacrylamid gel electrophoresi and display a singl arc on immunoelectrophoresi against polyval antiserum to whole human serum result from variou techniqu use in it character indic that thi protein is a fragment of alpha2macroglobulin alpha2m which is deriv from alpha2m by proteolyt cleavag of intact alpha2m subunit quantit of alpha2m level in plasma indic no signific differ between level of alpha2m in cf homozygot oblig heterozygot carrier or normal control plasma sampl quantit of arginin esteras activ in plasma treat with cloroform and ellag acid indic that both the total arginin esteras activ and that fraction of arginin esteras activ inhibit by soybean trypsin inhibitor sbti were decreas in most cf homozygot and oblig heterozygot plasma sampl rel to normal control valu the result of thi studi indic that plasma sampl from cf homozygot and oblig heterozygot carrier for cf show defici proteolyt cleavag of alpha2m as compar with normal control plasma and suggest that a structur abnorm in alpha2m or a defici in plasma proteolyt activ may be respons for thi defici in proteolysi
