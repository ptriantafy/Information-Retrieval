on the natur of the defect in cystic fibrosi sera and lymphocyt cultur media deriv from cystic fibrosi cf affect and carrier subject contain ciliari dyskinesia factor cdf detect by our rabbit tracheal bioassay in addit we also find cdf in fibroblast media from these same donor and in amniot fluid cell media deriv from cf carrier or affect fetus in these latter instanc the media were inact in the bioassay but becam activ when mix with purifi igg in all instanc cdf activ wa elimin by the addit of antiigg we have separ a low molecular weight fraction between 1000 and 10000 mw from cf sera and cultur media which is inact in the bioassay until igg is ad presumpt and indirect evid indic that thi fraction behav similarli to the complement deriv anaphylatoxin c3a in addit we have found activ in sera from cf patient and to a lesser extent carrier that induc degranul of cytochalasinb treat human polymorphonuclear leukocyt sinc thi activ appear to be in a differ molecular speci from that contain cdf we postul that the primari defect in cf is the defici of an enzym whose substrat includ a famili of membraneact molecul
