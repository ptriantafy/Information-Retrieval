disaccharidas activ in small intestin mucosa in patient with cystic fibrosi the disaccharidas activ in small intestin biopsi were relat to the morpholog of the mucosa and the age of 63 patient with cystic fibrosi and 177 healthi control subject of caucasian origin in patient with cf and in the healthi control subject under 5 year of age with normal intestin mucosa no low lactas activ wa found in those patient with cf who were over 5 year of age one group had high and one group had low lactas activ as occur in healthi caucasian control subject of the same age thi find support the view that in patient with cf lactas defici is not relat to the diseas entiti in patient with or without cf who had the same degre of mucos atrophi the decreas of disaccharidas activ follow the same pattern indic that enzym activ are affect to the same extent by the damag of the mucosa in patient with cf with pancreat insuffici the disaccharidas activ were significantli p less than 0001 higher when compar to those in control subject of the same age and ethnic group although the increas wa not uniform in all patient with cystic fibrosi
