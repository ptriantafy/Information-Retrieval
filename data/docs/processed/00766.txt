increas resist of cystic fibrosi fibroblast to ouabain toxic diploid skin fibroblast deriv from sever unrel patient with cystic fibrosi cf were test for resist to the cytotox effect of ouabain in comparison with cell from normal individu cell from cf and normal individu were plate at low densiti and expos to ouabain at differ concentr for 24 hr dose respons curv show that cf cell surviv significantli better than did normal cell at all ouabain concentr from 01 nm to 1 micronm in potassiumdefici medium in medium contain the usual amount of potassium 625 mm surviv of the cf cell expos to ouabain wa decreas to that of the normal cell if the glucos concentr of the potassiumdefici medium wa decreas to 10 of the usual amount the resist of the cf cell to ouabain disappear and their surviv wa ident to that of the normal cell these find may be use in understand the biochem basi of cg and it clinic manifest
