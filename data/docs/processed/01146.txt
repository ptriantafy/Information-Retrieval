alkalin phosphatas induct in cystic fibrosi fibroblast letter lysosom acid hydrolas and alkalin phosphatas cooper in the intracellular digest of natur polym a stimulu for the induct of these enzym is the retent of ani kind of polym insid the cell thi stimulu is longlast and strong if polym are intracellularli retain becaus of a lack of digest enzym in previou paper it ha been demonstr that the alkalin phosphatas aip induct with tamm horsfal glycoprotein discrimin between fibroblast of cf homozygot on the one hand and normal and cf carrier on the other hand and a hypothesi ha been propos to explain these observ as predict more effici induc mixtur have sinc been develop these have been use in the present studi the first writer familiar himself with ultramicrotechniqu and then carri out doubl blind studi on 20 fibroblast cultur from french patient these find demonstr the reproduc of the aip induct and of the method use and they particularli underlin the import of employ the present ultramicrotechniqu for a success aip induct it is like that amniot fluid cell behav like skin fibroblast in thi test if thi prove to be so then the induct of alkalin phosphatas should provid a use techniqu for the prenat diagnosi of cystic fibrosi
