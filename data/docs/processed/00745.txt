pulmonari clearanc of staphylococcu aureu in mutant mice with some hereditari alter resembl cystic fibrosi pulmonari clearanc for staphylococcu aureu ha been examin in two inbr strain of mice with some hereditari alter resembl cystic fibrosi cf these mice were mice with abnorm electrolyt metabol dbajcri mice with spontan pneumon c57bl6jbg and mice without ani cflike alter balbc the method use to produc pulmonari infect were essenti those of laurenzi and associ adapt as need for mutant mice the anim mention abov were expos to a fine divid aerosol suspens of a coagulaseposit strain of s aureu in phosphat buffer immedi after the exposur half of the anim were kill and the remain half were kill 4 hr later in each experiment unit the mice kill immedi after the exposur were as similar as possibl to the mice kill 4 hr later with respect to genotyp age and sex some were sibl the unclear bacteria ubr in 4 hr were 020 for the mice without ani cflike alter balbc and the c57bl6jbg bgbg genotyp 028 for c57bl6jbg genotyp 050 for the dba2jcri genotyp and 056 for cricri mice the number of viabl staphylococci found immedi after the aerosol exposur co in the c57bl6jbg strain is significantli lower than the co of the balbc p 005 and dba2jcri strain p 001 the latter two did not differ from each other there wa no sex differ with respect to the ubr and co data the dba2jcri strain of mice where the cri mutat first appear ha a decreas capac for clearanc of s aureu by the lung togeth with the other cflike alter of the cri mutat name failur for the reabsorpt of na by the parotid duct high level of na in the fur and cf abnorm serum factor activ in the serum of the cricri mice we suggest that the cribriform degener mous mutant may provid a potenti anim model for studi cf the find of a mous mutat with electrolyt alter and cflike abnorm serum activ simialr to the activ found in cf children in an inbr strain of mice with a decreas bacteri clearanc by the lung make these mice veri use for cf studi
