multipl of isol of pseudomona aeruginosa with differ antimicrobi suscept pattern from patient with cystic fibrosi clinic isol of pseudomona aeruginosa from patient with cystic fibrosi were studi in an effort to determin the uniqu characterist of the infect strain and to elucid the pattern of colon of 413 patient studi 81 were chronic infect with p aeruginosa patient from whom p aeruginosa wa never or onli occasion isol were in better clinic condit than the chronic infect patient isol were classifi into six morpholog varieti classic rough mucoid gelatin dwarf and enterobact most patient had two or more of these varieti such multipl varieti from the same individu were of the same serotyp but often differ in antibiot suscept as determin by both the disk and the minim inhibitori concentr method these differ were appar when mucoid strain were compar with nonmucoid strain and when nonmucoid strain were compar with one anoth studi of antibiot suscept should be perform on each morpholog differ type of p aeruginosa obtain from patient with cystic fibrosi
