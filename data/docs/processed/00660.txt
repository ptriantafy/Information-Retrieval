bile salt kinet in cystic fibrosi influenc of pancreat enzym replac bile acid kinet wa investig by stabl isotop dilut techniqu in 6 children age 3 12 month to 4 12 year with previous untreat cystic fibrosi all of the patient had clinic and laboratori evid of malabsorpt normal intestin mucos function as judg by glucos absorpt intestin histolog disaccharidas level and normal function gallbladd the children were maintain on a constant diet throughout the studi period fat intak averag 42 g per kg per day befor administr of pancreat enzym replac fat excret equal 50 plu or minu 4 mean plu or minu se of intak and wa reduc to 20 plu or minu 10 of intak after therapi total bile acid pool size nearli doubl dure enzym replac from 379 plu or minu 32 micromol per kg to 620 plu or minu 36 micromol per kg with secondari bile acid compris 57 of the total pool befor therapi and 40 after therapi total bile acid synthesi chang littl with therapi equal 139 plu or minu 17 micromol per kg per day total 602 plu or minu 109 mg per day without enzym replac and 125 plu or minu 19 micromol per kg per day total 470 plu or minu 86 milligram per day with enzym replac thi wa confirm by the fecal excret of bile acid 545 plu or minu 166 milligram of bile acid per day were excret without enzym as compar to 513 plu or minu 146 milligram per day with enzym after therapi the fraction turnov rate of the bile acid pool wa reduc from 0602 plu or minu 005 per day to 0233 plu or minu 03 per day for cholic acidand from 0696 plu or minu 009 per day to 039 plu or minu 004 per day for chenodeoxychol acid these data indic that both primari and secondari bile acid are conserv within the enterohepat circul dure enzym therapi and that the mechan for the regul of hepat bile acid synthesi is intact in cystic fibrosi howev the demonstr that larg amount of bile acid continu to be excret dure therapi suggest that interrupt of the enterohepat circul continu and that defici of the intralumin phase may persist dure enzym therapi in thi diseas
