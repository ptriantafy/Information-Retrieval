studi on cystic fibrosi use isoelectr focus iii correl between cystic fibrosi protein and ciliari dyskinesia activ in serum shown by a modifi rabbit tracheal bioassay we have develop a modifi rabbit tracheal bioassay for use in investig a possibl correl between cystic fibrosi protein cfp and ciliari dyskinesia factor cdf in human serum the bioassay requir high standard of tissu select and all epitheli tissu must be free of underli connect tissu when serum sampl were collect and process care and warm to 37 degre befor assay cdf could be reliabl detect in 31 of 31 sera from cystic fibrosi cf homozygot or oblig heterozygot in 35 min or less without prior fraction or concentr of sera wherea 13 of 14 normal control sera were nonreact cdfposit serum react in three consecut phase 1 initi increas in ciliari beat frequenc 2 ciliari dyskinesia and 3 tissu destruct with extrus of singl ciliat cell mucu and debri our result confirm the associ of cdf with cystic fibrosi the bioassay is not specif for cf howev when whole sera are bioassay sinc serum from sever patient with bronchial asthma also caus ciliari dyskinesia howev thi find need not preclud use rabbit tracheal ciliat epitheli tissu as an assay for follow the purif of cdf isoelectr focus show that the presenc or absenc of cfp correspond with that of dyskinesia activ in all sera test except for the activ sampl from seven asthma patient which were neg for cfp the result indic that cfp and cdf may be ident or close relat marker for the cf gene and suggest that the activ detect by the rabbit tracheal bioassay in sera from patient with asthma and other diseas probabl is caus by a substanc differ from a cf specif cdf
