classif of hereditari disord of sexual develop we have recent propos a classif of the disord of sexual develop base upon the presum site of action of the abnorm gene dure embryogenesi these disord which may be either genet or nongenet in natur are the result of disturb in the physiolog of sexual differenti dure embryogenesi the purpos of thi review is to summar the current physiolog concept of normal sexual differenti to review the known hereditari disord of sexual develop and to consid briefli the implic that these mutat have for the understand of normal sexual differenti the translat of genet sex into phenotyp sex is a complex process sinc some 19 hereditari singlegen determin disord of sexual develop are current recogn that involv loci on both the autosom and the x chromosom it can be infer that at a minimum 19 gene and henc 19 discret biochem step are involv in thi process at least 10 mutat result in male pseudohermaphrodit wherea onli 2 mutat are known to caus femal pseudohermaphrodit the predomin of male type of mutat is the result of the fact that the format of the male phenotyp is activ induc by the secret of the fetal testi wherea the format of the femal phenotyp doe not requir secret from the fetal ovari the end result of these mutat that involv the format and action of testosteron can be similar and it requir anatom endocrinolog and genet studi of individu patient to identifi the mutant gene involv undoubtedli mani more as yet unidentifi gene must particip in sexual differenti the identif of these gene will depend on the continu delin of new simpli inherit clinic syndrom ani fundament understand of the program of event in phenotyp differenti will requir not onli the identif of the gene involv but the elucid of the molecular mechan by which each of these gene is express
