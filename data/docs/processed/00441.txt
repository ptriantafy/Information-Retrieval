water and electrolyt of exocrin secret pp 17991 it ha been recogn that the level of water and electrolyt are derang in mani if not all of the exocrin secret of cystic fibrosi patient the sodium and chlorid level in serou secret from cf patient are elev in contrast the more proteinrich or mucoid isoton secret viz from the pancrea and tracheobronchi mucu gland are found to have sodium concentr near normal or even somewhat decreas howev these secret have significantli reduc water content the abnorm in hypoton secret appear to rise from a decreas na reabsorpt in the duct the low water content of the isoton secret of cf patient appear to result from decreas secret of water and electrolyt earli studi on tracheobronchi secret from cf patient led investig to suggest that the primari defect may be a decreas in the level of water and monoval ion in an attempt to provid a unifi hypothesi it ha been suggest that an increas calcium concentr in the variou exocrin secret lead to a hyperperm of the mucu line and thu to an excess loss of water and small ion the concentr of calcium in exocrin secret appear to follow the concentr of protein and especi the mucou glycoprotein it wa suggest that calcium may be an import factor in the increas viscos and insolubl of cf mucu organ ion are also potenti perturb of macromolecular structur in addit to a possibl perturb role polyamin have a potenti role in water and electrolyt transport
