enhanc dexamethason resist in cystic fibrosi cell potenti use for heterozygot detect and prenat diagnosi cultur skin fibroblast from patient with cystic fibrosi cf are more resist to dexamethason toxic than are normal cell we now report that when fibroblast cultur from oblig cf heterozygot are expos to dexamethason they have an intermedi surviv compar to normal and homozyg cf cell when dexamethason surviv wa test on cell from four patient undergo amniocentesi cell from a woman at risk of produc a child with cf show signific dexamethason resist similar to that of fibroblast deriv from lnown cf homozygot the other amniot cell specimen show dexamethason sensit similar to that of normal skin fibroblast these data suggest that the dexamethason resist previous observ in skin fibroblast may also be use in the prenat diagnosi of cf
