comparison between purifi alpha2macroglobulin prepar from normal control and patient with cystic fibrosi kinet and structur properti of the complex with bovin trypsin alpha2macroglobulin wa purifi from plasma obtain from three healthi control and three patient with cystic fibrosi the normal and patient prepar were indistinguish antigen and in their uv absorpt spectra competit inhibit by these prepar of the hydrolysi of benzoyllarginin ethyl ester by bovin trypsin wa observ the ki valu for normal alpha2macroglobulin wa 53 x 108 m as compar to 18 x 107 m for cystic fibrosi patient prepar the km valu of the alpha2macroglobulintrypsin complex were 63 x 104 m for the normal protein and 15 x 104 m with the alpha2macroglobulin from the cystic fibrosi patient gel chromatographi of normal alpha2macroglobulin preincub in molar ratio with bovin trypsin reveal the format of alpha2macroglobulin fragment these fragment were not obtain with the prepar from the cystic fibrosi patient both the normal and cystic fibrosi alpha2macroglobulin were shown by gel chromatographi in sodium dodecyl sulfat to be tetram noncoval bound after reduct and alkyl the monom were found to be a singl polypeptid chain the fragment obtain by preincub normal alpha2macroglobulin with trypsin had approxim half the molecular weight of the intact monom cystic fibrosi alpha2macroglobulin preincub with trypsin in sodium dodecyl sulfat a singl major compon ident to the intact monom with no format of alpha2macroglobulin fragment
