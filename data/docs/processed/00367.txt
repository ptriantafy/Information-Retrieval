amylas polymorph studi of sera and duoden aspir in normal individu and in cystic fibrosi prior genet studi of the human pancreat amylas amy2 locu have been direct princip to the electrophoret analysi of serum and urin on the assumpt that these fluid receiv neglig contribut from the salivari ami 1 locu in support of that assumpt wa the observ that the isozym band were lack in patient with cystic fibrosi and in a postpancreatectomi patient we have examin the sera of 97 patient have cystic fibrosi and find normal level of serum amylas on electrophoresi threequart of the cystic fibrosi patient have a pattern f pattern not observ in normal sera the pattern is character by the absenc of pa 1 compar electrophoresi and mix experi indic that the fpattern is of salivari origin and is unmask in cystic fibrosi by the absenc of a pancreat contribut the normal serum pattern is consid to be an admixtur of salivari and pancreat amylas on the assumpt that duoden fluid might more close reflect the pancreat ami 2 locu electrophoret studi were perform on 148 normal individu and 37 individu with cystic fibrosi electrophoret phenotyp in duoden aspir are more complex than previous report in studi of urin and serum presum becaus of the higher concentr of amylas in the aspir compar electrophoresi and mix experi indic that the phenotyp observ in duoden aspir also reflect admixtur of pancreat and salivari amylas thi recognit of pancreat and salivari admixtur in sera fortun doe not alter our prior understand of the genet of the ami 2 polymorph the extens studi which led to the delin of the ami 2 polymorph were essenti base on the presenc or absenc of a variant band which prove now to be outsid the zone of admixtur
