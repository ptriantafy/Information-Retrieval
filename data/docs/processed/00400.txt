effect of cystic fibrosi serum on the rat parotid gland inject of serum from human patient with cystic fibrosi into adult rat caus pronounc structur modif and increas mitot rate in the parotid gland mitot rate wa increas from a low level of 0021000 acinar cell in parotid gland of adult rat to 651000 acinar cell after 2 or 3 day of serum inject at the light and electron microscop level signific acinar cell atrophi and degranul were observ cellular necrosi and increas in quantiti of lysosomelik dens bodi mast cell and macrophag were also detect these chang are suggest of tissu respons to injuri foreign protein furthermor the fact that normal sera pronounc the same kind of effect but greatli reduc in extent strengthen the view that these effect result from the immunolog respons of the host organ to foreign antigen sinc howev the respons of the rat parotid to cystic fibrosi serum were consider more mark than those elicit by normal serum the rat parotid may thu have potenti use in assay for the presenc of human cystic fibrosi factor
