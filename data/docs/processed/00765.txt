increas dexamethason resist of cystic fibrosi fibroblast we demonstr previous that fibroblast from cystic fibrosi cf patient are significantli more resist to the toxic effect of ouabain than normal human fibroblast are ouabain is gener assum to act primarili at the level of the cell membran and to caus kill of cell by inhibit ion transport we have therefor examin the abil of normal and cf cell to surviv exposur to ethacryn acid anoth inhibitor of ion transport and to surviv colchicin and aminopterin resist to which ha been associ with membran alter in other cell the effect of dexamethason which ha a sterol nucleu similar to that of ouabain but is thought to have a differ site of cellular action wa also test exposur of the cell to ethacryn acid colchicin or aminopterin did not reveal ani differ in surviv between normal and cf fibroblast howev cf cell surviv exposur to dexamethason significantli better than normal cell did these result suggest that normal and cf cell do not differ in term of a gener resist to ion transport inhibitor or to drug that must pass through the membran to be activ instead the result rais the possibl that cf cell have an enhanc resist to drug that have the sterol nucleu found in ouabain and dexamethason
