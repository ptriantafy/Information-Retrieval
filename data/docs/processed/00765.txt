increased dexamethasone resistance cystic fibrosis fibroblast demonstrate previously fibroblast cystic fibrosis cf patient significantly resistant toxic effect ouabain normal human fibroblast ouabain generally assumed act primarily level cell membrane cause killing cell inhibiting ion transport therefore examined ability normal cf cell survive exposure ethacrynic acid another inhibitor ion transport survive colchicine aminopterin resistance associated membrane alteration cell effect dexamethasone sterol nucleus similar ouabain thought different site cellular action also tested exposure cell ethacrynic acid colchicine aminopterin reveal difference survival normal cf fibroblast however cf cell survived exposure dexamethasone significantly better normal cell result suggest normal cf cell differ term generalized resistance ion transport inhibitor drug must pas membrane active instead result raise possibility cf cell enhanced resistance drug sterol nucleus found ouabain dexamethasone
