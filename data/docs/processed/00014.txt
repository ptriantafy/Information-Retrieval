present statu of intrauterin diagnosi of genet defect prenat diagnosi of genet disord ha receiv increas attent dure the past sever year rapid expans of our knowledg of the basi of genet diseas and the develop of reliabl diagnost method have led to rapid advanc in the intrauterin diagnosi of a larg number of inherit disord prenat diagnosi wa initi use to determin the presenc of down syndrom and other chromosom abnorm and for the determin of fetal sex in pregnanc at risk for a number of sever xlink recess disord shortli thereaft it becam clear that the same techniqu could be appli to the prenat diagnosi of a number of the inborn error of metabol most recent a number of new techniqu have been develop that may prove to be of great valu in the prenat diagnosi of a number of sever congenit malform that befor now could not be diagnos prior to birth the goal of thi review is to defin the past achiev futur goal and present limit of intrauterin diagnosi the first section will deal with the gener approach use in prenat diagnosi of genet disord thi will be follow by a discuss of the specif applic of the basic techniqu to the intrauterin diagnosi of chromosom abnorm and of the inborn error of metabol approach to prenat diagnosi of genet disord includ amniocentesi direct and indirect visual of the fetu analysi of matern blood and urin and sampl of fetal tissu applic of prenat genet diagnosi includ xlink recess disord chromosom abnorm inborn error of metabol disord of lipid metabol disord of carbohydr metabol disord of mucopolysaccharid metabol disord of amino acid metabol and miscellan disord such as cystic fibrosi these techniqu provid some parent with method for have children without fear of have a child with a specif deform in addit to the develop of approach which will increas the number of disord detect in utero the potenti for treatment of genet disord is unlimit
