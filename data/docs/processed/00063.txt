serum protein paper electrophoresi in cystic fibrosi correl with clinic and radiolog find few studi of serum protein by mean of paper electrophoresi in patient with cystic fibrosi cf have been publish in these studi alter of the serum protein fraction were found some of which were significantli correl with the clinic and radiolog sever of the diseas in the present studi serum protein determin by paper electrophoresi in 95 patient with cf have been studi and correl with clinic and radiolog find the serum protein and electrophoret pattern if 95 patient with cf were follow for 1 to 6 year in each patient for cf patient as a whole total serum protein wa unchang wherea albumin and albuminglobulin ratio were decreas and all globulin fraction increas total serum protein wa increas in patient with sever pulmonari diseas the chang in total serum protein and in all protein fraction were significantli correl with clinic and radiolog sever of the lung diseas all termin patient had sever chang patient with complic liver cirrhosi had electrophoret pattern that did not differ from those of other cf patient it is conclud that the main caus for serum protein alter in cf is the lung affect wherea liver involv and malabsorpt probabl are of much less import
