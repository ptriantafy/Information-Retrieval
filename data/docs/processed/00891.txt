studi on the basic defect in cystic fibrosi the kinin hypothesi it is our hypothesi that in cystic fibrosi there is a genet determin specif defici in the activ of either the glandular kallikrein or in it activ enzym and that thi defect is the primari defect in the diseas the immedi consequ of either of these defect is the absenc of kallidin and the result failur of reabsorpt the fact that there may be mutat affect distinct enzym could account for the genet heterogen of cystic fibrosi a consequ of a defect kallikrein system would be accumul of a precursor relat to the low molecular weight kininogen and we propos that thi compound is the ciliarydyskinesia factor
