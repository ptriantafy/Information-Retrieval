anomal alpha 2macroglobulinproteas complex in cystic fibrosi decreas uptak of the complex by fibroblast in cultur immunochem and function properti of control and cystic fibrosi cf alpha 2macroglobulin alpha 2m are compar cross immunoelectrophoresi and ouchterloni doubl diffus reveal no qualit differ between the two alpha 2m prepar trypsinesteras activ assay with bapna as a substrat in the presenc of an excess sti gave similar ratio between total and activ alpha 2m these alpha 2mtrypsin complex were equal stabl under variou experiment condit and maintain a constant sti noninhibit esteras activ normal and cfalpha 2mtrypsin complex were taken up by normal human fibroblast to a similar extent dure a four hour period the onli signific differ wa observ when the uptak of alpha 2m from untreat sera wa examin the uptak of alpha 2m from cf sera wa alway lower than from pool control sera despit larg variat mix of control and cf serum did not affect the normal uptak and other serum compon were taken up to the normal extent intracellular degrad of cf alpha 2m had a half life of 20 to 28 hour which compar well to the normal half life of 22 hour more work need to be done on the natur of the interact between alpha 2m and proteas befor a reason explan for the molecular natur of the abnorm behavior can be sought
