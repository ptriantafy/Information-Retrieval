complex saccharid metabol in cystic fibrosi fibroblast there are sever report of secretori and other abnorm present in cultur fibroblast from patient with cystic fibrosi cf we have therefor investig aspect of complex saccharid synthesi and secret by such cell compar with fibroblast deriv from heterozyg hz parent and from normal n children the main glycosaminoglycan produc by skin fibroblast dure in vitro cultur were hyaluron acid heparan sulfat and dermatan sulfatelik materi use doublelabel experi with d3h or 14cglucosamin and analyz the product by ion exchang chromatographi it wa shown for five cf two hz and four n line that these polysaccharid were secret into the medium in approxim similar proport to each other moreov experi in which three cf nine hz and three n line were grown in log phase for up to 5 day in the presenc of 35ssulfat and 3hglucosamin indic that dure such a period cf fibroblast do not secret complex carbohydr at rate significantli differ from n or hz cell neither do such cell shown an abnorm intracellular accumul of complex carbohydr the latter observ wa further confirm by prepar whole cell autoradiograph dure growth of six cf two hz and three n line in the presenc of d3hglucosamin and subsequ after addit of unlabel medium
