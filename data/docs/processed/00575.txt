surfac enzym in cultur fibroblast from cystic fibrosi patient membran function wa examin in cultur cell from cystic fibrosi patient by assay sever enzym on intact skin fibroblast attach to cultur dish thi techniqu requir few cell and minim disrupt of cellular organ comparison of enzym activ of intact and broken cell show that 12 of total glucose6phosph dehydrogenas a cytoplasm enzym wa measur use intact cell while all adenosin monophosphatas wa measur use intact cell alkalin paranitrophenylphosphatas activ wa divid between the cell surfac and interior substrat competit experi indic that substrat specif for adenosin monophosphatas and paranitrophenylphosphatas activ were differ adenosin monophosphatas activ of 2 control and 2 cystic fibrosi strain fluctuat similarli dure the cell cultur cycl the appar km valu rel to adenosin monophosph were similar in all strain a chromatograph fraction of serum from a cystic fibrosi patient that wa inhibitori to oyster ciliari activ had no effect on adenosin monophosphatas activ of normal fibroblast furthermor fraction of media from cystic fibrosi homozygot and heterozygot fibroblast cultur were not inhibitori to adenosin monophosphatas activ of intact normal fibroblast or of part icul fraction prepar from them in light of previou studi that show that factor from cystic fibrosi serum of cultur medium disrupt specif membran activ it is propos that the cystic fibrosi factor interact with the plasma membran interf most conspicu with the protein function that are sensit to chang in their membran environ
