letter frequenc of cysticfibrosi gene mr stuart and dr burdon specul on the possibl that the high frequenc of the cysticfibrosi gene among caucasian may be due to the heterozygot have some advantag in biolog fit over normal homozygot they suggest that thi might be due to increas resist to typhu onc endem in europ on the basi of the wellknown immunolog crossreact between the caus organ rickettsia prowazeki and certain strain of the speci proteu vulgari which is agglutin by sera from cysticfibrosi patient and heterozygot howev there is no evid that thi agglutin is an immunolog reaction it appear microscop to be associ with disorganis and inhibit of the bacteri flagella lead to clump of the organ as such it is probabl analog to the effect on cilia of rabbit trachea and oyster or mussel gill the cilia factor although associ with igg is now known not to be igg itself and may well be the c3a compon of complement these and other observ such as those on salivari and sweat gland secret and on sodium flux suggest that all these phenomena are membran rather than immunolog effect although it is possibl that a proteu flagella antigen could also be the bind site for the cilia factor thi seem improb an altern hypothesi is that heterozygot for the cysticfibrosi gene have increas resist to tuberculosi thi would meet the requir of a common diseas recent endem in europ at least as well as typhu and is suggest by indirect evid from a famili studi demonstr a significantli lower incid of tuberculosi among the parent of cysticfibrosi patient than among parent of control
