effect of polyamin and cystic fibrosi serum on glucos transport the effect of plasma or serum from homozygot and heterozygot for the cystic fibrosi cf gene on the activ uptak of 3014cmethyl dglucos 3014cmdg by rat jejun epithelium wa studi furthermor the role of the polyamin spermidin and it product of metabol degrad on glucos transport were investig and a relationship to the pathogenesi of membran dysfunct in cystic fibrosi wa postul glucos transport in evert rat jejun ring wa use in the studi result were express as 3014cmdg concentr ratio between the intracellular icf and the extracellular fluid space ecf of the jejun ring at the end of a 60 min incub period the mean ratio obtain from incub of the rat jejun ring in medium consist of krebsring bicarbon buffer and the label sugar wa consid as 100 uptak when plasma or serum with or without spermidin wa mix with the medium in a volum ratio of 13 a decreas in the activ uptak of 3014cmdg wa observ express as percent inhibit percent inhibit of 3014cmdg uptak obtain when the rat jejun ring were incub in normal plasma wa compar to that obtain with plasma from cystic fibrosi genotyp it wa found that 1 plasma from 25 homozyg children had greater inhibitori effect on glucos uptak than plasma from 26 normal children 2 plasma from 9 heterozyg women had greater inhibitori effect than that from 6 normal women 3 the inhibitori effect of plasma from 3 homozyg children wa not influenc by dialysi 4 the inhibitori effect of pair plasma and serum sampl from 9 homozygot were compar 5 spermidin ad to the incub electrolyt solut did not affect glucos transport 6 the addit of spermidin to reaction mixtur contain normal plasma potenti the inhibitori effect and 7 mix and incub of fresh bovin serum with reaction mixtur contain plasma from homozygot decreas the inhibitori effect the predomin inhibitori effect of plasma or serum from homozygot and heterozygot for the cf gene appear to be relat to a nondialyz molecul it doe not seem to reflect the presenc of high plasma glucos level in cystic fibrosi nor to be the result of competit inhibit between sugar it doe not seem to be the result of sodium or other electrolyt differ a similar inhibitori effect is acquir by normal plasma after the addit of spermidin on the other hand plasma from cf homozygot lose it inhibitori effect after incub with fresh bovin serum these find may indic that product of metabol degrad of spermidin are respons for the inhibitori effect of glucos transport and suggest the possibl of a role in abnorm polyamin metabol in the pathogenesi of cystic fibrosi
