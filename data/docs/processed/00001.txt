pseudomona aeruginosa infect in cystic fibrosi occurr of precipit antibodi against pseudomona aeruginosa in relat to the concentr of sixteen serum protein and the clinic and radiograph statu of the lung the signific of pseudomona aeruginosa infect in the respiratori tract of 9 cystic fibrosi patient have been studi by mean of immunoelectrophoret analysi of patient sera for the number of precipitin against pseudomona aeruginosa and the concentr of 16 serum protein in addit the clinic and radiograph statu of the lung have been evalu use 2 score system precipitin against pseudomona aeruginosa were demonstr in all sera the maximum number in one serum wa 22 the concentr of 12 of the serum protein were significantli chang compar with match control person notabl igg and iga were elev and the acut phase protein were chang the latter suggest activ tissu damag the concentr of 3 of the acut phase protein notabl haptoglobin were correl to the number of precipitin suggest that the respiratori tract infect in patient with mani precipitin is accompani by more tissu damag than the infect in patient with few precipitin the result indic no protect valu of the mani precipitin on the tissu of the respiratori tract
