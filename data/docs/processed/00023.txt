human respiratori tract secret 1 mucou glycoprotein secret by cultur nasal polyp epithelium from subject with allerg rhiniti and with cystic fibrosi ciliat nasal polyp epithelium from patient with allerg rhiniti and patient with cystic fibrosi wa maintain in organ cultur for 168 hour explant epithelium retain it morpholog characterist and incorpor 35so4 and 3h into blood group specif glycoprotein that were secret into the medium throughout the cultur period label mucou glycoprotein wa solubil by reduct and alkyl then purifi by gel filtrat chromatographi purifi glycoprotein wa further separ on diethylaminoethyl deae cellulos column into 3 blood group activ fraction these fraction had similar amino acid composit but differ in nacetyl neuramin acid and fucos content and in rel incorpor of 35so4 and 3hglucosamin blood group glycoprotein from polyp epithelium of patient with allerg rhiniti and cystic fibrosi were indistinguish in mani respect howev the 35so4 per 3h ratio of all 3 glycoprotein fraction from patient with cystic fibrosi exceed that of the correspond fraction from secret of patient with allerg rhiniti
