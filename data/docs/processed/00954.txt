detect of cystic fibrosi protein by electrofocus letter wilson et al report a biophys assay for cystic fibrosi that employ isoelectr focus of serum protein their work appear to establish the presenc of a definit marker for cf serum in the form of a protein band that wa not present in normal serum we tri to repeat their work and found that the background color of the fresh electropherogram made it rather difficult to detect unequivoc the presenc or absenc of band in the appropri ph region in cf vs control serum howev when the gel were photograph use kodak panatom x film and a wratten 25 a red filter the color respons and contrast of the film elimin thi interfer to a great extent and it wa much easier to detect the put band we agre partial with the observ of wilson and fudenberg but would like to stress that the techniqu is not a diagnost test
