calcium and sodium transport process in patient with cystic fibrosi i a specif decreas in mg2depend ca2adenosin triphosphatas activ in erythrocyt membran from cystic fibrosi patient calciumatpas activ mg2depend ca2atpas atp phosphohydrolas ec 3613 in erythrocyt membran prepar from cystic fibrosi cf patient wa greatli reduc compar to erythrocyt membran from control subject the km for calcium wa found to be similar in the two group howev the vmax the maxim rate of activ of the ca2atpas is reduc by 50 in the erythrocyt membran prepar of the cf patient p less than 0001 in contrast the mg2atpas activ of erythrocyt membran from cf patient wa unchang compar to the control subject no differ in the nakatpas activ in erythrocyt membran from cf patient compar to control patient could be observ thi indic that the ca2atpas activ note in cf erythrocyt is not part of a gener membran or membranebound enzym alter it remain to be determin whether thi alter in ca2atpas activ is directli relat to a defect in calcium transport in these cell and is a gener phenomenon in cf present in cell type more directli involv in secret
