serum protein paper electrophoresi in cystic fibrosi correl with bacteriolog lung find serum protein have been studi by mean of paper electrophoresi in 88 patient with cystic fibrosi cf and correl with bacteriolog lung find an increas of all serum globulin fraction in cf patient wa found wherea albumin and albuminglobulin ratio were decreas the chang in all serum protein fraction were significantli greater in patient with constant pseudomona aeruginosa infect in the lung than in patient without thi constant infect p 0005 wherea patient with intermitt pseudomona infect did not have more sever chang than patient without pseudomona infect the chang in gammaglobulin and total globulin were significantli greater in patient with frequent staphylococcu aureu infect than in patient with rare staphylococcu aureu infect p 0005 and p 005 respect as regard the other serum protein fraction no signific differ between patient with frequent and rare staphylococcu infect were found judg by simpl score system the lung diseas of patient with constant pseudomona infect wa significantli more progress clinic and radiolog than that of patient without constant pseudomona infect p 000005 wherea no signific differ were found between the other patient group
