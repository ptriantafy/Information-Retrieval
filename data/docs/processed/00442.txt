polypeptid mediat of cystic fibrosi pp 25971 although complex model involv multipl loci may be plausibl the high frequenc of cystic fibrosi in caucasian is probabl best explain by select advantag for the heterozygot carrier in short an analog of cystic fibrosi with hemoglobin s sickl cell anemia may be greater than with taysach diseas in term of molecular mechan protein and polypeptid differ have been report for the humor fluid of cystic fibrosi patient and their heterozygot rel in connect with select bioassay system these direct relat to a model here propos for the intermedi stage of the physiolog of cystic fibrosi which build on a larg bodi of eleg experiment work the basic tenet is that the cell of cystic fibrosi heterozygot and normal individu are in a stimulatori loop chronic reserpin treatment exagger in the normal rat a loop similar to the one exagger by genet differ in the human elev to patholog level an otherwis normal process
