recent research in cystic fibrosi thi review emphas some of the posit accomplish of cystic fibrosi research some of the puzzl and some of the recent develop that have promis one of the major unresolv question is the mainten of thi lethal gene at such a high frequenc perhap becaus of a heterozygot advantag in the past no longer oper at present noth is known of the chromosom local of the trait except that chromosom are morpholog normal that it is autosom not sex link and that there is no correl with blood group or major hla loci one of the import achiev of the past mani year is that we understand rel well the pathogenesi of most clinic manifest of cf the as yet unknown inherit basic defect or metabol error of cf give rise to two main anomali the electrolyt defect in exocrin sweat gland and the mucou secret abnorm while the result of tissu cultur studi often have been conflict and dispar it doe seem to be the consensu that the fibroblast are affect by the basic metabol error in some manner and that they respond abnorm under differ experiment circumst virtual all investig have found some anomali in biolog fluid of cf although use differ approach and method an abnorm in the function of the autonom nervou system which is so close associ with the exocrin gland ha alway been an attract explan for the gener exocrinopathi of cf the search for a genet anim model for cf ha led to interest find
