cystic fibrosi effect of serum factor on mucu secret the effect of serum from children with cystic fibrosi and from normal children on the mucussecret ciliat epithelium have been investig in vitro use explant tissu from rabbit lung by optic and scan electron microscopi a sequenc of structur chang is observ after incub with cystic fibrosi serum thi sequenc doe not occur with normal serum the earliest chang involv swell of the goblet cell with subsequ discharg of mucu onto the epitheli surfac thi is follow by disrupt of the normal rapid and synchron ciliari activ mucu gradual extend over the surfac entangl cilia final some shed of ciliat cell occur from the epithelium these find suggest that factor in cystic fibrosi serum caus discharg of mucu lead to a disturb of the normal ciliari activ in the rabbit lung it is postul that such chang result in dysfunct of the mucociliari clearanc mechan and that thi dysfunct may be a contributori factor to the pathogenesi of lung diseas
