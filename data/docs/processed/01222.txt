mitrochondri nadh dehydrogenas in cystic fibrosi we have shown that skin fibroblast from patient with cystic fibrosi cf and from carrier for cf heterozygot hz consum more o2 than do their control when the mitochondri electron transport inhibitor rotenon wa ad to the cell the rel inhibit of o2 consumpt wa cf greater than hz greater than control p less than 0005 in both comparison becaus rotenon specif inhibit nadh dehydrogenas nadh acceptor oxidoreductas ec 16993 which is the enzym of energyconserv site 1 of the mitochondri electron transport system activ and kinet of thi enzym system were studi in fibroblast homogen nadh dehydrogenas activ wa equal in cell from the three genotyp at ph 80 affin of the enzym for it substrat wa cf greater than hz control at ph 86 affin wa cf greater than hz control p less than 0005 for the differ ph optima for the genotyp were without except 86 cf 83 hz and 80 control hz and control line were distinguish unequivoc in a blind test on the basi of differ in ph optima purifi mitochondri prepar reveal ph optima ident to those found in whole cell homogen these data suggest that the mutant gene respons for cf is express in the complex mitochondri nadh dehydrogenas system
