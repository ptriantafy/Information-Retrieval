influenc of mist tent therapi on sputum viscos and water content in cystic fibrosi the hypothesi that mist tent therapi decreas the viscos of sputum by direct liquefact of the sputum in the lower respiratori tract wa test in 6 patient with cystic fibrosi cf the first night all patient slept without the mist tent and the first morn sputum wa collect for analysi the follow 2 night patient were randomli alloc to a tent suppli by either a jet or ultrason nebul the earli morn sputum wa analys for volum viscos water content and dna content an index of purul there wa no relat between sputum viscos and dna content water content or volum furthermor there wa no consist relat between sputum viscos or volum expector and the presenc or absenc of an 8hour stay in the tent with either method of water nebul these result therefor suggest that mist therapi doe not consist influenc sputum viscos or volum in patient with cf abov a sputum water content of 90 further increas in water content do not influenc viscos
