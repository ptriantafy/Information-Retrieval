influence mist tent therapy sputum viscosity water content cystic fibrosis hypothesis mist tent therapy decrease viscosity sputum direct liquefaction sputum lower respiratory tract tested 6 patient cystic fibrosis cf first night patient slept without mist tent first morning sputum collected analysis following 2 night patient randomly allocated tent supplied either jet ultrasonic nebulizer early morning sputum analysed volume viscosity water content dna content index purulence relation sputum viscosity dna content water content volume furthermore consistent relation sputum viscosity volume expectorated presence absence 8hour stay tent either method water nebulization result therefore suggest mist therapy consistently influence sputum viscosity volume patient cf sputum water content 90 increase water content influence viscosity
