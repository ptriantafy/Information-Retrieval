the precipitin and hypersensit reaction in cystic fibrosi the larg number and wide varieti of precipitin detect in the sputum of cystic fibrosi patient suggest that the precipitin may be nonprotect and even harm to the patient these sputum precipitin were direct princip against food fungi bacteria and human bodi tissu on the other hand precipitin to staphylococcu alphahemolysin wa the main type of immunoprecipitin detect in cf serum and wa found in 60 of the serum specimen examin it seem like that the precipitin in patient with cf may be involv in the format of immun complex which in conjunct with complement may be respons for the respiratori and gastrointestin lesion that are common in patient with cf the immun complex may be the result of excess food and bacteri antigen escap across the gut and lung as a result of some abnorm of the siga system over 80 of the sputum specimen test gave posit precipitin in agar gel against human semin fluid and colostrum suggest that some of the antibodi form in cf patient could be direct against host tissu and may account for an autoimmunetyp reaction in cf crossreact between the hightit antibodi to staphylococcu and basement membran of lung and pancrea with complement activ may occur in cf and requir further studi the high number of bcell as detect by antibodi coat complement activ sheep erythrocyt and eac rosett may be partli respons for the synthesi of the varieti of antibodi detect in cf patient
