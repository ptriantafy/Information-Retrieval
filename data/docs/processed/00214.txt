cystic fibrosi the ciliari inhibitor is a small polypeptid associ with immunoglobulin g a small polypeptid within the molecular weight rang of 6000 to 11000 wa found in immunoglobulin fraction from sera of cystic fibrosi homozygot and heterozygot thi factor appear to be respons for interf with ciliari activ in oyster gill sinc it can be dissoci from igg without reduct cleavag it must be bound in a noncoval manner after it dissoci the igg fraction from cystic fibrosi sera no longer inhibit ciliari activ thi find explain the differ previous observ in the molecular weight of the ciliari inhibitor synthes by cultur cell and that of sera from cystic fibrosi genotyp
