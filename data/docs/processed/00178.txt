the serolog of pseudomona aeruginosa analys by mean of quantit immunoelectrophoret method ii comparison of the antibodi respons in man against thirteen o group of ps aeruginosa the occurr of antibodi against antigen prepar from strain repres 13 o group of pseudomona aeruginosa and against a polyval ps aeruginosa antigen stag ha been investig in sera from 100 patient by mean of fuse rocket immunoelectrophoresi with intermedi gel it wa found that the humor immun respons against ps aeruginosa result in precipit antibodi will be detect by stag as well as by ani other of the antigen sampl investig six of the sera contain groupspecif antibodi which were reveal by onli one of the antigen sampl use and not by stag these six sera were further studi by mean of variou quantit immunoelectrophoret method use stag as well as antigen prepar from the infect ps aeruginosa strain in the patient concern in all six sera onli one extra precipitin could be detect use antigen prepar from the homolog strain instead of stag thi extra precipitin correspond presum to groupspecif oantigen not includ in stag in sera from patient these groupspecif antibodi were alway accompani by antibodi against antigen common to all strain of ps aeruginosa
