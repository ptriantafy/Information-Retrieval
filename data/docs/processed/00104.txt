letter frequenc of cysticfibrosi gene an unsolv problem in human popul genet is the high frequenc of the gene for cystic fibrosi cf in caucasian wherea the gene frequenc is probabl low enough in noncaucasian to be maintain by recur mutat thi is not the case in caucasian where the carrier frequenc is approxim 1 in 25 in order to establish a stabl genet polymorph for a gene where the homozyg state is lethal some degre of heterozygot advantag must exist and it ha been suggest that cf heterozygot have a higher reproduct fit than normal individu it is not possibl of cours to know exactli how stabl the cf polymorph is and one cannot exclud the possibl that some form of heterozygot advantag ha exist at some time in the past and no longer exist today we should like to suggest a possibl explan which ha much in common with the gener accept explan for the veri high frequenc of the sicklecel gene in certain popul in the latter case heterozygot have an increas resist to a particular type of malaria patient with cf and heterozyg carrier have been found to have in their serum a substanc probabl a protein that agglutin proteu vulgari immunolog crossreact between certain strain of proteu eg ox 19 and rickettsia prowazeki ha long provid the basi of a serolog test for typhu weilfelix reaction thu it is conceiv that the cf heterozygot might have an increas innat abil to counter infect by r prowazeki although typhu is known in mani part of the world it seem to have been predominantli endem and epidem in the temper region inhabit by caucasian peopl some area where it is now endem such as south america first experienc the diseas after it had been introduc by european thi would seem to be compat with the observ higher cf gene frequenc in caucasian than in other group
