high speed cinemicrograph studi on rabbit tracheal ciliat epithelia cytolyt effect of cystic fibrosi serum on tracheal epitheli cell high speed cinemicrograph are made on the ciliari activ of rabbit tracheal cilia with the aid of nomarski optic the detail natur of the ciliari beat pattern is determin from slow motion analysi of the high speed cinemicrograph 13 such document form of ciliari beat pattern and the physiolog state of the tracheal epithelia are util as basic refer control to investig the physiolog effect of cystic fibrosi serum on ciliat epithelia and the cystic fibrosi tracheal mucu stagnat phenomenon care analys of the high speed cinemicrograph reveal that cystic fibrosi serum ha no effect on the rhythm and beat pattern of rabbit tracheal cilia howev it is shown in control procedur that cystic fibrosi serum ha a cytolyt effect on the tracheal epitheli cell and also at the cell junction ciliari dyskinesi as describ in previou report 69 is actual a secondari effect of cytolysi and cell destruct
