nitrogen balanc trial with cystic fibrosi patient preliminari nitrogen balanc trial have been carri out with six patient known to have pancreat insuffici to investig the utilis of protein from a gener diet protein from a gener diet plu exogen pancreat extract and predigest protein compris 85 of dietari nitrogen intak in the absenc of a pancreat supplement in all case the addit of pancreat supplement to the gener diet improv protein digest and utilis substitut 85 of the dietari protein with the enzym casein hydrolys result in further improv in nitrogen balanc but not digest for five of the patient urinari nitrogen level of the casein hydrolys diet tend to be lower which account for the find abov with the acidhydrolys protein urinari nitrogen wa higher when compar with the excret from the partial casein hydrolys and provid smaller posit nitrogen balanc these preliminari find indic that for some patient with pancreat insuffici partial hydrolys have greater potenti for nitrogen retent than the administr of exogen pancreat extract with intact protein it is suggest that a daili supplement of predigest protein might be advantag for ch children to ensur that minimum protein requir are met
