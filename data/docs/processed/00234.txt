screen for cystic fibrosi by analysi of meconium for albumin and proteas inhibitor a qualit method of detect elev meconium protein concentr wa compar with a method of determin meconium albumin concentr by electroimmunoassay sinc elev meconium protein level can indic pancreat insuffici caus by cystic fibrosi between 5 and 10 per 1000 healthi infant pass meconium specimen that gave a fals posit reaction with the boehring mannheim test strip and contain a greater than expect concentr of albumin it wa possibl to exclud pancreat insuffici in all of these children by determin the ratio albumin alpha1antitrypsin in meconium and subsequ faecal specimen sinc it wa found that valu of thi ratio in excess of 20 suggest pancreat insuffici of the type associ with cystic fibrosi three of 14 neonat with subsequ proven cystic fibrosi yield meconium specimen give neg test strip result and low albumin concentr in two of these patient the ratio albumin alpha1antitrypsin in the meconium wa within normal limit but within two month of birth the albumin alpha1 antitrypsin ratio in the faec of both children wa greater than 30 suggest that pancreat insuffici had develop
