screening cystic fibrosis analysis meconium albumin protease inhibitor qualitative method detecting elevated meconium protein concentration compared method determining meconium albumin concentration electroimmunoassay since elevated meconium protein level indicate pancreatic insufficiency caused cystic fibrosis 5 10 per 1000 healthy infant passed meconium specimen gave false positive reaction boehringer mannheim test strip contained greater expected concentration albumin possible exclude pancreatic insufficiency child determining ratio albumin alpha1antitrypsin meconium subsequent faecal specimen since found value ratio excess 20 suggested pancreatic insufficiency type associated cystic fibrosis three 14 neonate subsequently proven cystic fibrosis yielded meconium specimen giving negative test strip result low albumin concentration two patient ratio albumin alpha1antitrypsin meconium within normal limit within two month birth albumin alpha1 antitrypsin ratio faeces child greater 30 suggesting pancreatic insufficiency developed
