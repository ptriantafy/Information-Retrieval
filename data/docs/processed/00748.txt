separ of serum ciliari dyskinesia substanc from cystic fibrosi subject purifi serum immunoglobulin g igg deriv from eight cystic fibrosi cf and five carrier subject ha been shown to be respons for the mucociliari disturb note in the rabbit tracheal bioassay a small molecular substanc of less than 10000 but greater than 1000 dalton by amicon filtrat wa found associ with gammaglobulin fraction isol from sera of these same cystic patient and their parent onc separ by pm10 ultrafiltr thi small substanc wa unabl to promot the ciliari dyskinesia respons in eight of eight cf and five of five cf carrier individu unless pool purifi human igg wa ad in addit the iggrich fraction retain by pm10 ultrafiltr wa still abl to promot the ciliari dyskinesia respons in the bioassay an event note in our earlier work with whole serum the size of the small serum substanc and it associ with igg close correspond to that describ for the oyster test system as well as to that produc by cultur cell deriv from homozygot and heteroxygot for thi genet disord the persist of the abil to promot mucociliari disturb by the iggrich retent pm10 fraction may be indic of the ineffect molecular separ by the amicon ultransfiltr apparatu or may repres anoth cfrelat iggassoci substanc not influenc by ultrafiltr specul the genet disturb of cf can be explain by the presenc of a molecul which ha an affin for igg which in turn give rise to the variou physiolog facet of thi disord thi molecul is present in cf onli becaus of a defici of an enzym which normal control it level by inactiv
