evolut of plasmid in vivo in a strain of staphylococcu aureu a strain of staphylococcu aureu no far4 ha been isol from a patient at frequent interv over 18 month thi strain ha previous been shown to lose resist to sever antibodi lacey et al 1973 dure the last 6 month further chang have occur in it in vivo lincomycin resist appear after the patient had been treat with clindamycin thi wa due to mutat to constitut resist to both lincomycin and erythromycin at a locu adjac to that determin induc resist to erythromycin both loci are probabl carri by an extrachromosom element three type of variat in the pf plasmid were observ alter in product of penicillinas from macroconstitut to microconstitut wa not associ with ani detect chang in plasmid size thi chang gave the cell an advantag in vitro becaus it wa associ with a faster growth rate and probabl also in vivo becaus the microconstitut variant were isol in increas number after flucloxacillin therapi had ceas complet loss of determin for penicillinas product and for resist to cadmium ion from the pf plasmid wa associ with a decreas in plasmid size of about 4 x 10 6 dalton thi chang wa also associ with increas growth rate in vitro loss of resist to fusid acid from the pf plasmid wa associ with a decreas in plasmid size of about 1 x 10 6 dalton
