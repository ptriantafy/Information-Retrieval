erythrocyt transport function in cystic fibrosi atpas activ and monoval cation transport were examin in erythrocyt rbc of subject with cystic fibrosi cf the rbc membran ca2atpas activ of homozyg patient and oblig heterozygot wa indistinguish from that of normal control subject thi wa true similarli for total ouabainsensit and ouabaininsensit nakatpas total ouabainsensit and ouabaininsensit 24na transport were normal in cf cell ouabaininduc na accumul wa similar in cf and normal rbc measur of k transport in cf rbc were likewis normal we conclud that intrins atpas and monoval transport function are normal in cf rbc we were unabl to confirm sever abnorm in these cell report previous the cf rbc is not help in defin a transport abnorm in that entiti these studi document normal intrins transport function in rbc of patient with cf there have been report of an abnorm serum factor in patient with cf thi factor might be involv in the product of a transport defect in cf further studi are indic to determin whether cf plasma contain a factor capabl of alter membran transport function of normal rbc
