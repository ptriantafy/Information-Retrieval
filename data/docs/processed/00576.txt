review of the growth characterist of cystic fibrosi and normal human diploid fibroblast in vitro the growth kinet of human diploid skin fibroblast deriv from cystic fibrosi cf homozygot cf heterozygot and normal individu wa determin the popul doubl time increas with time in cultur and no differ wa observ between the 3 genotyp test the cell cycl time remain constant through the 10th subcultur while the growth fraction or fraction of cell in the cell cycl decreas with cultur time howev chang in the growth fraction and popul doubl time appear to be relat to cellular senesc in vitro rather than to cystic fibrosi
