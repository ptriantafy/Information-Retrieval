pseudomona aeruginosa infect in cystic fibrosi relationship between mucoid strain of pseudomona aeruginosa and the humor immun respons the occurr of pseudomona aeruginosa in the respiratori tract of 70 cystic fibrosi patient and the occurr of precipitin against ps aeruginosa in sera from the same patient have been investig dure one year by mean of monthli bacteriolog examin of tracheal secret and by mean of cross immunoelectrophoresi of a polyval ps aeruginosa antigen against sera from the patient the oneyear period preval rate of patient harbour ps aeruginosa wa 64 per cent in newli colon patient and in intermitt colon patient nonmucoid strain were predomin wherea mucoid strain were predomin in chronic colon patient the occurr of mucoid strain especi in chronic colon patient wa associ with a significantli higher number of precipitin against ps aeruginosa than the occurr of nonmucoid strain male chronic colon with mucoid strain present a significantli higher number of precipitin than femal chronic colon with mucoid strain and the number of precipitin wa correl with the durat of the chronic colon with ps aeruginosa in male in contrast to femal the result are in accord with the hypothesi that mucoid substanc could be a virul factor becaus it might inhibit the opson effect of the precipitin on the mucoid cell and the complement depend lysi of the cell herebi favour mucoid strain at the expens on nonmucoid strain in the respiratori tract of cystic fibrosi patient
