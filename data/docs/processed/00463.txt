inflammatori reaction and airway damag in cystic fibrosi in cystic fibrosi there is chronic infect and inflammatori reaction in the airway accompani by destruct and shed of airway epithelium leukocyt migrat into the airway and some disintegr liber deoxyribonucleoprotein that is incorpor into the gel structur of the bronchial mucu we compar the statu of these process in cystic fibrosi with that in chronic bronchiti and bronchiectasi by examin the sputum rais from the lower airway measur also were made on sputum induc in normal subject the result indic that migrat of leukocyt into the airway and shed of damag airway epithelium were minim in the normal subject they were signific in the patient with chronic bronchiti higher in those with bronchiectasi and still higher in those with cystic fibrosi the larg increas found in the total content of dna and solid in the cystic fibrosi sputum were due to increas in the insolubl fraction contain the whole leukocyt and particul debri that remain when the sputum mucu gel wa solubil with mercaptoethanol despit the larg increas in the total content of dna and solid the content of mucu gel compon and of deoxyribonucleoprotein from disintegr leukocyt actual present in the mucu gel structur of the cystic fibrosi sputum were not significantli higher than in the sputum from the patient with chronic bronchiti or brochiectasi
