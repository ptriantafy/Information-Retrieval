glycoprotein and cystic fibrosi a review thi articl is a review of the major research of the last 20 year on abnorm glycoprotein and abnorm glycoprotein metabol in cystic fibrosi it purpos is to focu attent on an area consid by the author to be of great import for elucid the primari biochem defect in cf the major of the studi on glycoprotein in cf have been done on crude mixtur of glycoprotein from tissu or tissu fluid secret or excret veri few studi have compar the properti and composit of purifi glycoprotein from cf patient and control compar studi on the enzym involv in the degrad and biosynthesi of the carbohydr portion of glycoprotein in cf patient and normal control are discuss sever studi have suggest abnorm in cf alphalfucosidas and cf lfucos metabol there are sever studi which indirectli suggest that abnorm in glycoprotein or their metabol may be involv in the pathogenesi of cystic fibrosi fruit area for futur investig are comparison of the properti and composit of specif glycoprotein purifi to homogen from cf and control tissu particularli with regard to carbohydr composit comparison of the activ and properti of the enzym involv in both the degrad and biosynthesi of glycoprotein in cf and control tissu and studi of the effect of increas electrolyt concentr on the physicalchem properti of glycoprotein
