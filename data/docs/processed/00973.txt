pleiotrop drug resist in cystic fibrosi fibroblast increas resist to cyclic amp in previou studi cystic fibrosi cf fibroblast were demonstr to be resist to the cytotox effect of ouabain dexamethason and the sex hormon dihydrotestosteron 17beta estradiol and progesteron we now show that cf fibroblast also exhibit greatli increas resist to the cytotox effect of exogen dibutyryl cyclic amp camp as well as to isoproterenol and theophyllin drug which are known to increas endogen level of camp cf cell were also shown to have normal amount of 3hcamp bind to protein kinas as well as normal amount of camp stimul protein kinas activ phosphodiesteras in cf cell wa also found to be stimul by camp to the same degre as in normal cell these find suggest that there is no detect protein kinas defici in cf cell cf cell thu appear to be unlik some campresist mutant describ by other which are defect in protein kinas activ and camp regul of phosphodiesteras level the crossresist of cf fibroblast to ouabain steroid hormon and camp may provid a uniqu opportun to studi the biochem event involv in the metabol of these drug as well as the basic biochem defect in a common human genet diseas
