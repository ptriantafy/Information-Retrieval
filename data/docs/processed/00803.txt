relationship among digit club diseas sever and serum prostaglandin f2alpha and e concentr in cystic fibrosi patient nine patient with cystic fibrosi but without digit club group a were match prospect by sex and approxim age to 9 cystic fibrosi patient with digit club group b and to 9 normal person control subject patient in group b had significantli p less than 005 lower clinic score and forc vital capac than did those in group a indic more sever pulmonari diseas in the former howev other spiromet test of pulmonari function reveal no differ between group a and b the degre of digit club had signific p less than 005 linear relationship to forc vital capac r 073 and clinic score r 0853 for group a and b plasma concentr of prostaglandin f2alpha and e were significantli increas p less than 005 in both group a x se 048 003 and 087 010 ng per ml respect and group b x se 068 004 and 181 016 ng per ml respect compar to the control group x se 014 001 and 039 002 ng per ml respect group b had significantli larger concentr than did group a howev plasma concentr of prostaglandin 15keto13 14 dihydro metabolit were not differ in group a and b and were significantli smaller than in the control group these studi suggest that the degre of digit club in cystic fibrosi is relat to the sever of the pulmonari involv and that the prostaglandin system may play an import role in thi diseas
