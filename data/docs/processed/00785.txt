electrolyt in nail analys by xray microanalysi in electron microscopi consider on a new method for the diagnosi of cystic fibrosi patient with cystic fibrosi cf have an increas concentr of sodium in their nail hitherto onli neutron activ analysi ha been consid for the diagnosi of cystic fibrosi by analysi of electrolyt in nail it ha been thoroughli test methodolog and clinic howev the intrins advantag of xray microanalysi and the result obtain in thi studi suggest that thi method after further test may be a use diagnost acid for cystic fibrosi in comparison with neutron activ analysi xray microanalysi ha the advantag of simultan give the concentr of sever element and may be access at ani hospit with an electron microscop fit with the necessari equip nail of cfpatient are here shown to have increas concentr of na k and cl which will make the diagnosi of cystic fibrosi more reliabl the possibl of use sulphur as a refer element may elimin the weigh procedur necessari in neutron activ analysi
