adenosin 35cyclic amp in fibroblast from patient with cystic fibrosi and it relationship to secret becaus of the known involv of cyclic amp in the control of secret in exocrin and other mammalian cell we have studi cyclic amp metabol in cultur cystic fibrosi cell in the hope of demonstr such an abnorm a detail comparison of 5 cf and 5 control strain show that the cf cell synthes 3 time more intracellular cyclic amp than control in thi paper we present data on an addit 10 cf and 10 control strain measur of intracellular cyclic amp did not provid the same clearcut differ between the cf and control strain as we had previous observ the cf strain synthes more cyclic amp than control but the differ wa not as larg as in our earlier studi and there is consider overlap between the two group it is not clear whi these two studi should have yield such dispar result
