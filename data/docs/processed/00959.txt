salivary amylase cystic fibrosis marker disordered autonomic function total serum amylase determined 83 patient cystic fibrosis cf 14 steatorrhea 21 control patient 6 patient shwachmans syndrome patient cf steatorrhea therefore lacked pancreatic function serum level pre postprandially control subject whereas patient without steatorrhea therefore evidence pancreatic function significantly higher level patient shwachmans syndrome significantly lower total serum amylase three patient group patient shwachmans syndrome demonstrated significant postprandial rise activity salivary isoenzyme detected patient shwachmans syndrome cf apparently absent pancreatic function whereas cf patient without steatorrhea salivary pancreatic isoenzymes result demonstrate patient cf increase circulating salivary amylase isoenzyme whereas patient shwachmans syndrome increase probably reflects autonomic hyperstimulation salivary secretion primary cf unrelated state pancreatic activity
