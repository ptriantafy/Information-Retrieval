letter essenti fatti acid and cystic fibrosi i have measur the fattyacid profil of cf erythrocyt membran in view of the fact that some variat in membran activ have been observ with thi system the result show that there wa a lower content of linol 182 and arachidon 204 in cf erythrocyt membran and the total essentialfattyacid content wa significantli lower than either control group there wa no signific differ in the concentr of the other major fatti acid palmit stearat and oleat and we could not observ ani strike alter in the concentr of ani of the minor fattyacid compon of the membran it would thu appear that the overal fattyacid pattern in cf erythrocyt membran is alter onli by a diminut in those fatti acid which are of dietari origin the fact that there wa consider overlap between the cf and control data make it rather unlik that the fattyacid profil close reflect the biochem lesion of the diseas when the essentialfattyacid level of the cf sampl were compar with the schwachman clinic score of the patient there wa a surprisingli poor correl r 049 which wa not statist signific the correl with the nutrit part of the clinic score wa equal low diminish essentialfattyacid content is often observ in mani acut ill in addit the possibl exist that cf patient may be particularli suscept to essentialfattyacid deplet due to their pancreat dysfunct further research on fattyacid transport and metabol in cf is clearli need to establish the role of essenti fatti acid in the diseas
