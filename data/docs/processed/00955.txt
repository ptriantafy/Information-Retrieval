the chronic reserpin rat as a possibl model for cystic fibrosi vii alter in the secretori respons to cholecystokinin and to secretin from the pancrea in vivo the chronic reserpin rat ha been propos as an anim model for cystic fibrosi on the basi of morpholog and secretori alter in the submaxillari gland and of abnorm in pulmonari secret in thi investig the volum and composit of pancreat juic from reserpin treat rat 05 mgkgday have been compar to those of untreat control after stimul with purifi cholecystokinin 01 microgramkg bodi weight and with crude and purifi prepar of secretin 6 microns100 g bodi weight infus iv for 30min period the result demonstr that the treat anim secret a significantli lower volum of pancreat juic after stimul with these secretagogu flow rate were also significantli reduc after stimul with cholecystokinin and crude secretin protein and amylas output in respons to cholecystokinin were smaller than in control anim after unrestritc feed but greater after a 24hr fast total bicarbon output wa also reduc after stimul with either crude or purifi secretin and the normal excret pattern for bicarbon and chlorid were either absent of revers in the secretinstimul pancreat juic of the treat anim whole pancrea homogen from the treat anim show signific increas in ca and protein content these result indic that chronic administr of reserpin alter the secret of water protein and bicarbon from the rat pancrea and that it affect sever of the exocrin gland involv in cystic fibrosi these find lend support to the concept of an anim model for the human diseas the chronic administr of reserpin to rat ha been shown to induc alter in salivari and pulmonari secret which resembl those seen in patient with cystic fibrosi the concept of an anim model ha been propos on the basi of these observ the pancrea is anoth exocrin gland promin involv in cystic fibrosi and if it can be demonstr that reserpin administr also induc alter in pancreat secret the concept of the anim model would be strengthen consider
