research in cystic fibrosi second of three part tissuecultur studi involv metachromasia glycosaminoglycan rna methyl cell membran and ciliatox activ in medium are describ although not fulfil the hope of a quick rout to discoveri of the basic defect in thi diseas that were rais by the first find the studi of fibroblast in cystic fibrosi ha given import inform the evid at present indic that lysosom and probabl other intracellular organel are normal in morpholog and function in cystic fibrosi sever humor abnorm have been found in cystic fibrosi those that influenc ciliari activ in experiment model those that affect membran transport and the abnorm in polyamin distribut a number of abnorm humor factor have been found in cystic fibrosi the limit in their interpret are seriou the assay use to delin these abnorm are often not univers reproduc some becaus of their inher variabl and other becaus they are technic forbid therefor unifi definit of the socal cystic fibrosi factor is not possibl at present
