enzym of phospholipid metabol in airway secret of patient with asthma cystic fibrosi and alveolar proteinosi phospholipas a2 lysolecithinas and lysolecithinlysolecithin acyltransferas are present in the airway secret of patient with asthma cystic fibrosi cf and alveolar proteinosi assay of these enzym under the same condit in extract of human polymorphonuclear leukocyt alveolar macrophag and pig tracheal mucosa indic that these extracellular airway enzym were probabl not deriv from these cell type although the abov three enzym were present in secret of all patient with these three diseas larg amount of palmitoyl lysolecithin free fatti acid and dipalmitoyl lecithin were found onli in patient have alveolar proteinosi and asthma the amount of free fatti acid in these secret wa suffici to inhibit both the lysolecithinas and the lysolecithinlysolecithin acyltransferas but not the phospholipas a2 these find suggest that the larg amount of dipalmitoyl lecithin free fatti acid and lysolecithin found in these secret result from extracellular remodel by these enzym becaus the phospholipas a2 wa present in larg amount it wa possibl after delipid to purifi it to homogen it is a stabl enzym with an appar molecular weight of 75000 as estim by sdsmercaptoethanol gel electrophoresi
