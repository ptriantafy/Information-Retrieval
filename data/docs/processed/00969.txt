cystic fibrosi compar with the immotilecilia syndrom a studi of mucociliari clearanc ciliari ultrastructur clinic pictur and ventilatori function patient with cystic fibrosi cf were investig for mucociliari clearanc with and without stimul by terbutalin clinic pictur ventilatori function and ultrastructur of cilia the result were compar with those of patient with congenit immotil cilia immotilecilia syndrom mucociliari clearanc could be demonstr in all the seven cf patient who succeed in inhal the test aerosol ciliari ultrastructur from a deceas cf patient wa normal patient with the immotil cilia syndrom had no substanti clearanc and defect cilia the cf patient cough more dure the clearanc measur than ani other group studi earlier and their cough wa effect one patient succeed in avoid cough in both measur and had faster clearanc when he got terbutalin than when he got the vehicl although younger the cf patient tend to be more obstruct in their lung and more handicap than the patient suffer from the immotilecilia syndrom the latter patient had more discomfort from rhiniti sinus and otiti than had the cf patient an impair of the mucociliari transport rate is henc unlik to be a primari pathogen factor for the respiratori tract diseas in cf patient
