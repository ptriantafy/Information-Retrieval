INDICATE
THAT
BOTH

BILE
ACIDS
ARE
CONSERVED
WITHIN
THE
ENTEROHEPATIC

THAT
THE
MECHANISM
FOR
THE
REGULATION
OF

ACID

IS
INTACT
IN
CYSTIC

HOWEVER
THE
DEMONSTRATION
THAT
LARGE
AMOUNTS
OF
BILE
ACID
CONTINUE
TO
BE
EXCRETED
DURING
THERAPY
SUGGESTS
THAT
INTERRUPTION
OF
THE
ENTEROHEPATIC
CIRCULATION
CONTINUES
AND
THAT
DEFICIENCIES
OF
