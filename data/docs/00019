WE
ASSAYED
THE
SERUM
OF
A
GROUP
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
THAT
WERE
ON
ORAL
ARGININE
THERAPY

THIS
TREATMENT
FOR
TOTAL
ARGININE
ESTERASE
ACTIVITY
THE
UNTREATED
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS

HAVE
SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER
SERUM
ARGININE
ESTERASE
ACTIVITY
THAN
THE

CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CARRIERS
AND
THE
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
RECEIVING
ORAL
ARGININE
THERAPY
THERE
IS
NO
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE

WE
HAVE
RECENTLY
OBSERVED
DIFFERENCES
IN
THE
