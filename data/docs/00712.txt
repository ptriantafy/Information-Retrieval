THE
BM
MECONIUM
TEST
IS
A
USEFUL
SCREENING
TEST
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HOWEVER
WE
HAVE
HAD
FALSEPOSITIVE
RESULTS
IN
TWO
BABIES
CAUSED
BY
THE
USE
OF
RECTAL
GLYCERIN
SUPPOSITORIES
THE
BABIES
PRESENTED
WITH
SIGNS
SUGGESTIVE
OF
INTESTINAL
OBSTRUCTION
POSSIBLY
DUE
TO
MECONIUM
ILEUS
AND
GLYCERIN
SUPPOSITORIES
WERE
INSERTED
TO
SPEED
THE
PASSAGE
OF
MECONIUM
SO
THAT
THE
BM
TEST
COULD
BE
DONE
TO
HELP
CONFIRM
THE
DIAGNOSIS
THE
TESTS
WERE
POSITIVE
BUT
THE
BABIES
WERE
SUBSEQUENTLY
SHOWN
NOT
TO
HAVE
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
WE
FOUND
THAT
THE
GLYCERIN
SUPPOSITORIES
THEMSELVES
PRODUCE
THE
TYPICAL
BLUE
COLOUR
ON
THE
TEST
STRIP
