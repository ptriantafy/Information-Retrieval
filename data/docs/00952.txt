THE
PROGNOSIS
FOR

SURVIVAL
STATISTICAL
DISCRIMINANT
ANALYSIS
IS
APPLIED
TO
41
CONCOMITANT
VARIABLES
OBTAINED
DURING
THE
FIRST
YEAR
OF
STUDY
OF
226
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
A
DISCRIMINANT
FUNCTION
BASED
ON
SIX
VARIABLES
IS
DEVELOPED
WHICH
CAN
BE
USED
AS
A
PREDICTIVE
INDEX
THIS
INDEX
ESTIMATES
THE
PROBABILITY
OF
5YEAR
SURVIVAL
FOR
AN
INDIVIDUAL
PATIENT
AND
CAN
ALSO
BE
USED
TO
CLASSIFY
PATIENTS
INTO
ONE
OF
TWO
GROUPS
1
WILL
LIVE
FOR
5
YEARS
OR
2
WILL
DIE
WITHIN
5
YEARS
SPECULATION
A
CLASSIFICATION
RULE
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
PRESENTED
WHICH
CORRECTLY
ASSIGNS
90
OF
THE
5YEAR
SURVIVORS
AND
84
OF
THOSE
WHO
EXPIRE
SUCH
A
