CONCENTRATIONS

DETERMINED
USING

WHO
STANDARD
IN

SERA
TAKEN
DURING
LONG
TERM
TREATMENT
OF
45
CHILDREN
WITH
CF
FROM
2
MONTHS

16
YEARS

THEY
WERE
SHOWN
TO
DEPEND
MARKEDLY
ON
THE
CLINICAL
STATE
OF
THE
CHILDREN
PARTICULARLY
ON
THE
PRESENCE
OF
PULMONARY
TRACT
INFECTIOUS
PROCESSES
THESE
INFECTIONS
CAUSED
A
RISE
IN
IMMUNOGLOBULIN
CONCENTRATION
WITH
PREDOMINANCE
OF
IGM
IN
CF
CHILDREN
AGED
UP
TO
3
YRS
AND
WITH

CHILDREN
MEAN
TITER
OF
ISOHEMAGGLUTININS
IN
CHILDREN
WITH

IN
HEALTHY
CHILDREN
LOW
TITERS
OF
DIPHTHERIAL
AND
STAPHOLOCOCCAL
ANTIBODIES
WERE
FOUND
IN
THE
CASE
OF
ANTI
DIPHTHERIA
ANTIBODIES
THIS
CAN
BE
ATTRIBUTED
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
THESE
CHILDREN
ARE
NOT
REGULARLY
VACCINATED
OWING
TO
THEIR
POOR
CLINICAL
CONDITION
AS
TO
THE
LOW
TITER
OF
ANTISTAPHYLOCOCCAL
ANTIBODIES
THIS
IS
A
WELL
KNOWN
FINDING
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
CHRONIC
STAPHYLOCOCCAL
INFECTIONS
