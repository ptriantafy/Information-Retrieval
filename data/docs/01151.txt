RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
CLINICAL
CONDITIONS
CHEST
RADIOGRAPHIC
FINDINGS
AND
RESPIRATORY
FUNCTION
TESTS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WE
EXPLORED
44
CHILDREN
SUFFERING
FROM
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WITH
PREDOMINANT
PULMONARY
INVOLVEMENT
AND
FOLLOWED
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
COURSE
OF
ILLNESS
OF
30
OF
THESE
PATIENTS
DURING
AN
AVERAGE
PERIOD
OF
4
YEARS
WE
WERE
IMPRESSED
BY
THE
ENORMOUS
VARIABILITY
OF
THE
PULMONARY
SYMPTOMATOLOGY
IN
THESE
CHILDREN
THE
QUESTION
AROSE
WHETHER
THIS
CLINICAL
IMPRESSION
IS
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
FINDING
OF
THE
THORAX
RADIOGRAPH
AND
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
LUNG
FUNCTIONS
TESTS
AND
THE
BLOOD
GAS
MEASURES
AT
REST
AND
ON
EXERCISE
FROM
THE
CLINICAL
POINT
OF
VIEW
THERE
IS
A
POSSIBILITY
TO
MAKE
A
CLASSIFICATION
OF
SEVERITY
IN
PULMONARY
ASPECTS
OF
THIS
DISEASE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
LARGE
RANGES
OF
THE
SCORE
VALUES
A
CLEAR
DISTINCTION
OF
THE
SEVERITY
COULD
ONLY
BE
POSSIBLE
IF
LARGE
GROUPS
OF
PATIENTS
WERE
TO
BE
COMPARED
FOR
THE
INTERINDIVIDUAL
COMPARISON
THE
CUMULATIVE
EVALUATION
OF
A
CLINICAL
SCORE
THE
CHEST
RADIOGRAPH
AND
THE
LUNG
FUNCTION
TESTS
ARE
INDISPENSABLE
ONLY
THE
CONTINUOUS
FOLLOWUP
OF
THESE
EXAMINATIONS
ALLOWS
ONE
TO
NOTICE
IN
TIME
A
PROGRESSIVE
LUNG
INVOLVEMENT
WITH
ITS
DEGENERATIVE
CHANGES
