OFFERS
US
A
COMPLEX
PATTERN
OF
STRUCTURAL
AND
FUNCTIONAL
INTERACTION
WE
ARE
JUST
BEGINNING
TO
REALIZE
HOW

IT
IS
INFORMATION

ITS
MODIFICATION

REMODELING
BY

AND
APPROPRIATE
TECHNIQUES
ARE
AVAILABLE
THAT
WILL

US
TO

OUR
QUESTIONS
WITH
DUE
REGARD
FOR
ANATOMIC
PRECISION
AND
FUNCTIONAL
IMPLICATION
AND
SO
RESEARCH
WILL
LEAD
TO

IT
CAN
