THE
SEARCH
FOR
THE
BASIC
DEFECT
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAS
SO
FAR
BEEN
SINGULARLY
DISAPPOINTING
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
THAT
IT
IS
A
DISEASE
RECESSIVELY
INHERITED
IE
THAT
THE
PARENTS
CARRY
THE
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
GENE
WITHOUT
SHOWING
ANY
SIGNS
OF
ILL

HETEROZYGOUS

WHEN
TRANSMITTED

BOTH
OF
THEM
