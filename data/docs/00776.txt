CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
IS
A
SERIOUS
GENETIC
DISORDER
OCCURRING
MAINLY
AMONG
THE
WHITES
AND
STARTING
IN
EARLY
CHILDHOOD
OR
EVEN
AT
BIRTH
THE
NAME
IS
A
SHORTENING
OF
THE
OLD
TERM
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
OR
FIBROCYSTIC
DISEASE
OF
THE
PANCREAS
THIS
COMES
FROM
THE
HISTORICAL
APPEARANCE
AT
POSTMORTEM
FIRST
DESCRIBED
BY
LANDSTEINER
IN
1905
IT
WAS
ONLY
IN
1938
THAT
DOROTHEE
ANDERSON
AND
FANCONI
REALISED
THAT
THE
DISEASE
WAS
A
SEPARATE
ENTITY
AND
NOT
SIMPLY
A
MANIFESTATION
OF
OTHER
ILLNESSES
ANOTHER
NAME
IS
MUCOVISCIDOSIS
WHICH
GIVES
A
CLUE
AS
TO
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
FEATURES
OF
THE
DISEASE
MUCUS
FORMED
IS
THICKER
AND
STICKIER
MORE
VISCID
THAN
NORMAL
AND
TENDS
TO
CLOG
UP
THE
BRONCHI
AND
DUCTS
PARTICULARLY
THE
PANCREATIC
DUCTS
CHRONIC
BRONCHITIS
WITH
RECURRENT
SEVERE
INFECTION
AND
MALABSORPTION
ARE
THE
MAIN
SYMPTOMS
OF
THE
DISEASE
THE
OTHER
IMPORTANT
ABNORMALITY
IS
AN
INCREASED
AMOUNT
OF
SODIUM
CHLORIDE
SALT
IN
THE
SWEAT
THIS
FACT
USED
IN
THE
DIAGNOSIS
WAS
FIRST
REALISED
DURING
A
HEAT
WAVE
IN
NEW
YORK
IN
1953
WHEN
IT
WAS
NOTICED
THAT
MOST
OF
THE
CHILDREN
WITH
HEAT
PROSTRATION
SUFFERED
FROM
CF
LITTLE
IS
KNOWN
OF
THE
CAUSES
OF
THE
ABNORMALITIES
OF
SWEAT
AND
MUCUS
SOME
GENERALISED
CELL
ABNORMALITY

ENZYMATIC
SEEMS
POSSIBLE
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
THAT
THE
CONDITION
IS
GENETICALLY
TRANSMITTED
AND
MOST
EVIDENCE
FAVOURS
A
RECESSIVE
MODE
OF
INHERITANCE
