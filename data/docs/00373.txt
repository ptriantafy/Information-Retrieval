DEVELOPMENTAL
FACTORS
INFLUENCING
INTERACTIONS
OF
DRUGS
THE
AUTHOR
HAS
ATTEMPTED
TO
SUMMARIZE
THE
CURRENT
STATE
OF
KNOWLEDGE
REGARDING
DISPOSITIONAL
PROCESSES
IN
INFANTS
AND
CHILDREN
OF
VARIOUS
AGES
THE
TRADITIONAL
PROCESSES
OF
ABSORPTION
DISTRIBUTION
METABOLISM
AND
EXCRETION
ARE
DESCRIBED
NOT
ONLY
IN
NEWBORN
INFANTS
BUT
ALSO
IN
INFANTS
AND
CHILDREN
OF
OTHER
AGE
GROUPS
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
EFFECTS
OF
AGE
AND
THE
EFFECTS
OF
DISEASES
WHICH
ARE
OFTEN
UNIQUE
TO
EACH
STAGE
OF
POSTNATAL
DEVELOPMENT
UPON
DRUG
ACTION
AND
DISPOSITION
IS
A
VITAL
AND
NECESSARY
PREREQUISITE
TO
A
DISCUSSION
OF
INTERACTIONS
OF
DRUGS
OF
ABUSE
IN
THE
PEDIATRIC
POPULATION
IT
IS
ESSENTIAL
THAT
THE
DEVELOPMENTAL
STATUS
OF
THE
HOST
BE
TAKEN
INTO
CONSIDERATION
WHEN
EXAMINING
INTERACTIONS
OF
DRUGS
IN
INFANTS
AND
CHILDREN
THE
MECHANISMS
OF
INTERACTIONS
ARE
SIMILAR
TO
THOSE
SEEN
IN
THE
ADULT
PATIENT
THE
DEVELOPMENTAL
STATUS
OF
THE
PEDIATRIC
PATIENT
ALSO
PLAYS
A
SIGNIFICANT
ROLE
IN
THE
MANIFESTATIONS
OF
DISEASE
SEEN
IN
SICK
INFANTS
AND
CHILDREN
THESE
ARE
OFTEN
PROFOUND
AND
CONSEQUENTLY
MAY
PLAY
A
MAJOR
ROLE
IN
MODIFYING
DRUG
ACTION
AND
INTERACTION
