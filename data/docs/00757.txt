HEMOGLOBINOXYGEN
EQUILIBRIUM
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
A
STUDY
OF
35
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
INCREASING
SEVERITY
OF
PULMONARY
INVOLVEMENT
WAS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
A
MILD
BUT
DEFINITE
INCREASE
IN
ERYTHROCYTE
23DIPHOSPHOGLYCERATE
23
DPG
AND
A
DECREASE
IN
HEMOGLOBIN
AFFINITY
FOR
OXYGEN
THE
PREDOMINANT
REGULATORS
OF
23DPG
WERE
BLOOD
PH
CARDIAC
OUTPUT
AND
SYSTEMIC
OXYGEN
TRANSPORT
NO
SIGNIFICANT
RELATIONSHIP
WAS
OBSERVED
BETWEEN
ERYTHROCYTE
23DPG
CONTENT
AND
ARTERIAL
OXYGEN
TENSION
HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA
MAY
HAVE
PREVENTED
A
GREATER
INCREASE
IN
ERYTHROCYTE
23DPG
CONTENT
THE
INADEQUATE
INCREASE
IN
23DPG
AND
CONSEQUENT
INSUFFICIENT
CHANGE
IN
HEMOGLOBINOXYGEN
AFFINITY
COUPLED
WITH
AN
INSUFFICIENT
COMPENSATORY
ERYTHROCYTIC
RESPONSE
MAY
ADVERSELY
AFFECT
