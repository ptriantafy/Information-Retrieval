EARLY
INSULIN
RESPONSE
TO
RAPID
INTRAVENOUS
INJECTION
OF
GLUCOSE
WAS
STUDIED
IN
7
CASES
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AGED
8
MONTHS
TO
9
12

A
RADIOIMMUNOLOGICAL
METHOD

WERE
DETERMINED
AND

CALCULATED
IN
ALL

THE

INSULIN
RESPONSE
VALUES
WERE
LOW
COMPARED
WITH
NORMAL
CHILDREN
THE

WERE
NORMAL

CORRELATED
NEITHER
TO
THE

THE
EXPLANATION
OF
THE
DECREASED
INSULIN
RESPONSE
IS
PROBABLY
THE
PROGRESSIVE
FIBROSIS
OF
THE

ALSO
EXPLAIN
THE
