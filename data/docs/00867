OBSERVED
IN
THE
LARGE

OF

PATIENTS
INCLUDING
CRYPT
ENLARGEMENT
AS
WELL
AS
INTRACELLULAR
AND
EXTRACELLULAR
ACCUMULATION
OF
MUCUS
HAVE
BEEN
CONSIDERED
BY
SOME
TO
BE
USEFUL
DIAGNOSTIC
SIGNS
OF
THIS
DISEASE
THE
EXTENT
OF
THESE
CHANGES
HOWEVER
HAS
NOT
BEEN
EVALUATED
QUANTITATIVELY
IN
THIS
STUDY
QUANTITATIVE
STEREOLOGICAL
METHODS
WERE
APPLIED
TO
BIOPSIES
OF
RECTAL
MUCOSA
FROM
5

PATIENTS
5
SIBLING
CONTROLS
AND
2

ADULTS
TO
MEASURE

NUMBERS
CRYPT
LUMINAL
VOLUME
AND
VOLUME
OF
INTRACELLULAR
MUCUS
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
CF
CRYPT
LUMINA
WERE
VARIABLY
DILATED
BUT
THAT
THE
AVERAGE
RELATIVE
VOLUME
OF
INTRACELLULAR
MUCUS
AND
THE
NUMBERS
OF
GOBLET
CELLS
IN
CF
MUCOSAE
WERE
COMPARABLE
TO
THOSE
OF
SIBLING

ADULT
CONTROLS
IN

HOWEVER
SURFACE

ACCUMULATED
