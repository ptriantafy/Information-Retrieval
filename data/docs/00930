MANY
ATTEMPTS
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
TO
ESTABLISH
A
SUITABLE
SCREENING
TEST
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
FOR
NEWBORNS
RECENTLY
A
NEW
METHOD
HAS
BEEN
DESCRIBED
BY
CROSSLEY
AND
HER
ASSOCIATES
IT
IS
BASED
ON
MEASURING
PANCREATIC
TRYPSIN
IN
A
SAMPLE
OF
FAECES
COLLECTED
ON
TO
FILTER
PAPER
ON
THE
4TH
OR
5TH
DAY
OF
LIFE
THE
FALSENEGATIVE
RATE
OF
THE
NEW
TEST
HAS
NOT
YET
BEEN
DETERMINED
BUT
OLDER
CHILDREN
WITH
CF
AND
PANCREATIC
ACHYLIA
ALL
GAVE
ABNORMAL
RESULTS
WHEN
TESTED
THE
DISADVANTAGE
OF
THE
TEST
AS
WITH
THE
MECONIUM
ALBUMIN
TEST
IS
THAT
ABOUT
10
OF
CHILDREN
WITH
CF
ARE
SAID
NOT
TO
HAVE
PANCREATIC
ACHYLIA
WHILST
THE
METHOD
NEEDS
MORE
EXTENSIVE
EVALUATION
IT
APPEARS
TECHNICALLY
MORE
SATISFACTORY
THAN
OTHERS
SO
FAR
DESCRIBED
