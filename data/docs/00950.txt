ISOLATION
AND
PHYSICAL
PROPERTIES
OF
A
SALIVARY
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
FACTOR
A
CILIOSTATIC
FACTOR
HAS
BEEN
ISOLATED
FROM
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
SALIVA
BY
DIALYZING
IT
FROM
PURIFIED
ALPHAAMYLASE
PREPARED
BY
A
GLYCOGENCOMPLEX
METHOD
THIS
METHOD
OF
ISOLATING
THE
CF
FACTOR
IS
AN
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
THE
PREVIOUSLY
EMPLOYED
HEPARIN
PROCEDURE
THE
ACTIVITY
OF
THE
ISOLATED
FACTOR
IS
PROPORTIONAL
WITH
CONCENTRATION
USING
THE
OYSTER
GILL
CILIOSTATIC
ASSAY
AND
IN
ITS
INHIBITION
OF
MAMMALIAN
GLYCOGEN
DEBRANCHING
ENZYME
THE
CILIOSTATIC
ACTION
OF
THE
FACTOR
CAN
BE
REVERSED
BY
HEPARIN
UNDER
CERTAIN
CONDITIONS
THE
TYPE
OF
INHIBITION
OF
THE
DEBRANCHING
ENZYME
BY
THE
ISOLATED
CF
FACTOR
INDICATES
THAT
ITS
CHEMICAL
STRUCTURE
IS
SIMILAR
TO
THAT
OBSERVED
WITH
HYDROXYALKYLAMINES
AND
POLYAMINE
METABOLITES
PHYSICAL
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
ISOLATED
FACTOR
INDICATE
THAT
IT
IS
OF
LOW
MOLECULAR
WEIGHT
AND
IS
LABILE
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
PH
AND
TEMPERATURE
AT
NEUTRAL
PH
THE
CONDITIONS
UNDER
WHICH
IT
IS
MAINTAINED
HAVE
A
DIRECT
EFFECT
ON
THE
LENGTH
OF
TIME
THAT
IT
IS
STABLE
