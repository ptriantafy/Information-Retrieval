AN
EVALUATION
OF
THE
FORCED
EXPIRATION
TECHNIQUE
AS
AN
ADJUNCT
TO
POSTURAL
DRAINAGE
A
CRITICISM
OFTEN
LEVELLED
AT
THE
FORCED
EXPIRATION
TECHNIQUE
FET
IS
THAT
IT
INCREASES
AND
MAY
EVEN
PRODUCE
BRONCHOSPASM
IT
WAS
OUR
IMPRESSION
THAT
THE
USE
OF
FORCED
EXPIRATION
WHEN
COMBINED
WITH
PERIODS
OF
RELAXED
DIAPHRAGMATIC
BREATHING
DID
NOT
AGGRAVATE
BRONCHOSPASM
AND
SHORTENED
THE
POSTURAL
DRAINAGE
SESSION
TWO
GROUPS
OF
PATIENTS
WERE
STUDIED
24
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
TO
EVALUATE
THE
USE
OF
THE
FET
AS
AN
INDEPENDENT
MEANS
OF
POSTURAL
DRAINAGE
AND
20
ASTHMATIC
PATIENTS
TO
ASSESS
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
FET
ON
BRONCHOSPASM
THE
STUDIES
INDICATE
THAT
THE
FORCED
EXPIRATION
TECHNIQUE
INCREASES
THE
EFFICIENCY
OF
POSTURAL
DRAINAGE
BUT
DOES
NOT
INCREASE
AIRWAY
OBSTRUCTION
THIS
TECHNIQUE
CAN
BE
APPLIED
TO
BOTH
MEDICAL
AND
SURGICAL
CONDITIONS
WHEN
POSTURAL
DRAINAGE
OR
A
MODIFIED
FORM
OF
POSTURAL
DRAINAGE
IS
INDICATED
