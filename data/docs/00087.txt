A
METHOD
SUITABLE
FOR
THE
STUDY
OF

FUNCTION
IN
CHILDREN
IS
DESCRIBED
THE
METHOD
IS
SIMPLE
TO
PERFORM
TAKES
ONLY
2
MIN
AND
PROVIDES
PICTORIAL
AND
NUMERICAL
INFORMATION
ON
REGIONAL
VENTILATION
AND
PERFUSION
AND
A
SCALING
FACTOR
MEASURED
AFTER
REBREATHING
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
REGIONAL
VARIATION
IN
LUNG
SIZE
AND
SHIELDING
ALTHOUGH
THE
AVAILABILITY
OF
A
COMPUTER
SYSTEM
SUCH
AS
THE
ONE
DESCRIBED
IN
THE
TEXT
IS
ESSENTIAL
FOR
