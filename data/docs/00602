FIBROSIS
LETTER
THE
ARTICLE
BY
TOWNES
ET
AL
PROVIDES
CONFIRMATION
OF
OUR
INITIAL
STUDIES
WITH
REFERENCE
TO
THE
ISOAMYLASE
PATTERNS
OF
SERUM
DUODENAL
FLUID
AND
URINE
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
HOWEVER
THE
IMPRESSION
GIVEN
BY
TOWNES
ET
AL
IN
THEIR
ARTICLE
IS
THAT
THEIR
DATA
ARE
THE
FIRST
DEMONSTRATION
OF
ISOAMYLASE
ABNORMALITIES
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
I
WISH
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
OUT
PREVIOUS
WORK
PUBLISHED
2
YEARS
EARLIER
AND
NOT
REFERENCED
BY
TOWNES
ET
AL
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
CF
PATIENTS
HAD
DECREASED
AMOUNTS
OF
PANCREATIC
ISOAMYLASE
IN
THEIR
SERUM
AND
URINE
AND
THAT
THE
DUODENAL
ASPIRATES
IN
CF
PATIENTS
CONTAINED
BOTH
SALIVARY
AND
PANCREATIC
AMYLASE
WE
CONCLUDED
AS
ELUDED
TO
BY
TOWNES
ET
AL
THAT
SALIVARY
AMYLASE
IN
THE
DUODENAL
FLUID
WAS
PROBABLY
SECONDARY
TO
THE
INTUBATION
PROCEDURE
