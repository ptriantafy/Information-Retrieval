CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
A
DILEMMA
IN
THE
METABOLIC
PATHOGENESIS
OF
GENETIC
DISEASE
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
PATHOLOGICAL
OBSERVATIONS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
WERE
MADE
OVER
THREE
DECADES
AGO
MORE
RECENTLY
PHYSIOLOGICAL
FINDINGS
HAVE
DIRECTED
INVESTIGATION
TOWARD
A
PLETHORA
OF
HUMORAL
SUBSTANCES
AND
THEIR
POSSIBLE
ROLE
IN
DISTURBANCES
OF
THE
SECRETORY
PROCESSES
IN
CF
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THE
TECHNIQUES
OF
MOLECULAR
BIOLOGY
AND
OF
TISSUE
CULTURE
IS
BEGINNING
TO
INCREASE
OUR
KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT
THE
SOCALLED
CF
FACTORS
AND
THEIR
DIVERSE
EFFECTS
ON
EPITHELIAL
AND
CILIATED
SURFACES
EMPHASIS
IN
CURRENT
RESEARCH
IS
ON
THE
CHEMICAL
CHARACTERIZATION
OF
THE
CF
FACTORS
THE
METABOLISM
OF
CELLS
CULTURED
FROM
PATIENTS
WITH

AND
THE

CONTROLLING
THE
PROCESSES
OF

SOME
CURRENT
THEORIES

TO
THE
