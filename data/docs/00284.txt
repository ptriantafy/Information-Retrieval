WE
BELIEVE
THAT
SERUMLEVELS
OF
INDIVIDUAL
COMPLEMENT
COMPONENTS
IN
CHILDREN
CANNOT
BE
MEANINGFULLY
INTERPRETED
UNLESS
THEY
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
NORMAL
VALUES
OBTAINED
FROM
AGEMATCHED
CONTROLS
IN
A
STUDY
OF
163
HEALTHY
INFANTS
AND
CHILDREN
WE
FOUND
A
STATISTICALLY
SIGNIFICANT
CORRELATION
OF
C3
LEVELS
WITH
AGE
BUT
NOT
WITH
SEX
OR
RACE
AND
WE
ALSO
FOUND
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
VALUES
WITHIN
ANY
GIVEN
AGEGROUP
IN
CONTRAST
TO
PREVIOUS
REPORTS
WE
DID
NOT
FIND
RAISED
C3
LEVELS
IN
THE
MAJORITY
OF
OUR
CF
PATIENTS
WHEN
THE
VALUES
WERE
COMPARED
WITH
PROJECTED
GROUP
MEAN
VALUES
FOR
THE
APPROPRIATE
AGE
AND
WE
DID
NOT
FIND
A
SIGNIFICANT
ELEVATION
OF
THE
MEAN
C3
LEVEL
FOR
THE
CF
PATIENTS
IN
ANY
OF
THE
AGEGROUPS
TESTED
