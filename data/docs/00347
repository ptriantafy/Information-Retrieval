PROTEINS
OF
BRONCHOPULMONARY
SECRETIONS
FROM
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ASTHMA
AND
BRONCHITIS
THE
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
NINE
PLASMA
PROTEINS
WERE
DETERMINED
BY
QUANTITATIVE
IMMUNOELECTROPHORESIS
IN
SPUTUM
SPECIMENS
FROM
29
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
AND
FROM
24
PATIENTS
WITH
SEVERE
ASTHMA
AND
CHRONIC
BRONCHITIS
THE
RESULTS
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
POPULATION
OF
CF
PATIENTS
COULD
BE
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
GROUPS
IN
SPITE
OF
AN
ABSENCE
OF
DIFFERENCE
IN
CLINICAL
STATUS
BETWEEN
THE
GROUPS
AVERAGE
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
SEVEN
PLASMA
PROTEINS
IN
SPUTUM
OF
GROUP
I
CF
PATIENTS
WERE
IDENTICAL
WITH
THOSE
IN
SPUTUM
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
BRONCHITIS
BUT
THE
AVERAGE
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
SIX
OF
THESE
PROTEINS
IN
SPUTUM
FROM
GROUP
II
CF
PATIENTS
WERE
HIGHER
THAN
THOSE
IN
SPECIMENS
FROM
THE
BRONCHITIC
PATIENTS
AND
WERE
SIMILAR
TO
CORRESPONDING
CONCENTRATIONS
IN
SPUTUM
FROM
PATIENTS
WITH
ASTHMA
ALL
OF
WHOM
WERE
EXAMINED
WHILE
IN
STATUS
ASTHMATICUS
THE
AVERAGE
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
14
SECRETORY
PROTEINS
WERE
THE
SAME
IN
ALL
SPUTUM
SPECIMENS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
WERE
PRODUCED
BY
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ASTHMA
OR
BRONCHITIS
IT
WAS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
CONCENTRATIONS
IN
THE
BRONCHOPULMONARY
SECRETIONS
OF
PROTEINS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
HOST
DEFENCE
WERE
NOT
DIMINISHED
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
FAILURE
TO
PRODUCE
ADEQUATE
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
PROTEINS
WITH
ANTIMICROBIAL
ACTIVITY
WAS
UNLIKELY
TO
BE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
ABOVE
AVERAGE
SUSCEPTIBILITY
TO
CHEST
INFECTION
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IT
IS
SUGGESTED
THAT
THERE
EXISTS
A
GROUP
OF
CF
PATIENTS
IN
WHOM
A
PULMONARY
ALLERGIC
REACTION
GENERATES
AN
INFLAMMATORY
RESPONSE
AS
SEVERE
AS
THAT
CHARACTERIZING
STATUS
ASTHMATICUS
AND
THAT
THIS
RESPONSE
COULD
BE
DETRIMENTAL
