PROGRESS
IN
SCREENING
FOR
INBORN
ERRORS
OF
METABOLISM
THE
INBORN
ERRORS
OF
MATABOLISM
ARE
A
SERIES
OF
INDIVIDUALLY
RARE
BIOCHEMICAL
ANOMALIES
SOME
OF
WHICH
CAUSE
SERIOUS
CLINICAL
MANIFESTATIONS
THEY
ARE
OF
GREAT
INTEREST
TO
BIOCHEMISTS
AND
GENETICISTS
AS
WELL
AS
TO
PAEDIATRICIANS
AND
INTERNIST
FOR
WHOM
THEY
OFTEN
PRESENT
SPECIAL
DIAGNOSTIC
AND
THERAPEUTIC
PROBLEMS
THE
STUDY
OF
THE
INBORN
ERRORS
OF
METABOLISM
ALSO
HAS
IMPLICATIONS
IN
THE
FIELDS
OF
EPIDEMIOLOGY
AND
SOCIAL
MEDICINE
THE
NUMBER
OF
KNOWN
INBORN
ERRORS
OF
METABOLISM
HAS
INCREASED
RAPIDLY
IN
RECENT
YEARS
AND
OTHERS
AS
YET
UNIDENTIFIED
PRESUMABLY
AWAIT
RECOGNITION
ONLY
A
FEW
OF
THESE
CONDITIONS
CAN
BE
TREATED
NOW
BUT
THE
REALISATION
THAT
EARLY
DIAGNOSIS
IS
ESSENTIAL
IN
ORDER
TO
ACHIEVE
GOOD
RESULTS
HAS
STIMULATED
INTEREST
IN
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
EXAMINING
EITHER
WHOLE
POPULATIONS
OR
SELECTED
PREDISPOSED
GROUPS
OF
INDIVIDUALS
FOR
BIOCHEMICAL
DIFFERENCES
WHICH
CHARACTERISE

INHERITED
METABOLIC
DISEASES

WITH

THE

THE

ARE

THE

INDIVIDUALS
WHO
ARE
HETEROZYGOUS
FOR
THE
ABNORMAL

CAUSING
THE

MAY
BE
IMPORTANT

AND
THE
