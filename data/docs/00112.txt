WE
WISH
TO
RESPOND
TO
THE
LETTER
OF
DR
WOODS
AND
DR
DI
SANTAGNESE
REGARDING
THEIR
STUDY
ON
THE
RELIABILITY
OF
THE
CILIARY
ASSAYS
IN
CYSTICFIBROSIS
SCREENING
THESE
INVESTIGATORS
CONCLUDED
THAT
RESULTS
FROM
THEIR
STUDY
RULED
OUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
RELIABLE
CONCLUSIONS
COULD
BE
OBTAINED
FROM
CILIARY
ASSAYS
WE
FEEL
THAT
THIS
CONCLUSION
IS
FAR
FROM
ACCURATE
ALTHOUGH
IT
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
THE
INTENTION
OF
ANY
OF
OUR
RESEARCH
GROUPS
TO
UTILISE
CILIARY
PREPARATIONS
FOR
MASSIVE
HETEROZYGOTE
SCREENING
OR
PRENATAL
DIAGNOSIS
CILIARY
ASSAYS
HAVE
PROVIDED
VALUABLE
SCIENTIFIC
PROGRESS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
RESEARCH
THE
EXISTING
ASSAYS
ARE
NOT
SUITABLE
FOR
MASSIVE
SCREENING
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
OR
FOR
THE
CLINICAL
DETECTION
OF
CYSTICFIBROSIS
CARRIERS

THESE
TECHNIQUES
OFFER
THE
MOST
PROMISING
METHOD
