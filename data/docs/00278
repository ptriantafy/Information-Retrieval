ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACIDS
AND
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
I
HAVE
MEASURED
THE
FATTYACID
PROFILE
OF
CF
ERYTHROCYTE
MEMBRANES
IN
VIEW
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
SOME
VARIATIONS
IN
MEMBRANE
ACTIVITY
HAVE
BEEN
OBSERVED
WITH
THIS
SYSTEM
THE
RESULTS
SHOW
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
LOWERED
CONTENT
OF
LINOLEATE
182
AND
ARACHIDONATE
204
IN
CF
ERYTHROCYTE
MEMBRANES
AND
THE
TOTAL
ESSENTIALFATTYACID
CONTENT
WAS
SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER
THAN
EITHER
CONTROL
GROUP
THERE
WAS
NO
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
THE
OTHER
MAJOR
FATTY
ACIDS
PALMITATE
STEARATE
AND
OLEATE
AND
WE
COULD
NOT
OBSERVE
ANY
STRIKING
ALTERATION
IN
THE
CONCENTRATION
OF
ANY
OF
THE
MINOR
FATTYACID
COMPONENTS
OF
THE
MEMBRANE
IT
WOULD
THUS
APPEAR
THAT
THE
OVERALL
FATTYACID
PATTERN
IN
CF
ERYTHROCYTE
MEMBRANES
IS
ALTERED
ONLY
BY
A
DIMINUTION
IN
THOSE
FATTY
ACIDS
WHICH
ARE
OF
DIETARY
ORIGIN
THE
FACT
THAT
THERE
WAS
CONSIDERABLE
OVERLAP
BETWEEN
THE
CF
AND
CONTROL
DATA
MAKES
IT
RATHER
UNLIKELY
THAT
THE
FATTYACID
PROFILE
CLOSELY
REFLECTS
THE
BIOCHEMICAL
LESION
OF
THE
DISEASE
WHEN
THE
ESSENTIALFATTYACID
LEVELS
OF
THE
CF
SAMPLES
WERE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
SCHWACHMAN
CLINICAL
SCORES
OF
THE
PATIENTS
THERE
WAS
A
SURPRISINGLY
POOR
CORRELATION
R

049
WHICH
WAS
NOT
STATISTICALLY
SIGNIFICANT
THE
CORRELATION
WITH
THE
NUTRITIONAL
PART
OF
THE
CLINICAL
SCORE
WAS
EQUALLY
LOW
DIMINISHED
ESSENTIALFATTYACID
CONTENT
IS
OFTEN
OBSERVED
IN
MANY
ACUTE
ILLNESSES
IN
ADDITION
THE
POSSIBILITY
EXISTS
THAT
CF
PATIENTS
MAY
BE
PARTICULARLY
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
ESSENTIALFATTYACID
DEPLETION
DUE
TO
THEIR
PANCREATIC
DYSFUNCTION
FURTHER
RESEARCH
ON
FATTYACID
TRANSPORT
AND
METABOLISM
IN
CF
IS
CLEARLY
NEEDED
TO
ESTABLISH
THE
ROLE
OF
ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACIDS
IN
THE
DISEASE
