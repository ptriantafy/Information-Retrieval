DETECTION
OF
HETEROZYGOTES
WE
HAVE
DEVELOPED
A
NEW
TECHNIQUE
FOR
DETECTING
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
AND
THE
HETEROZYGOTE
OF
CF
THE
ASSAY
CAN
BE
DONE
BY
ANY
LABORATORY
HAVING
AN
AGGREGOMETER
FOR
MEASURING
PLATELET
AGGREGATION
QUANTITATION
OF
THE
RESULTS
IS
OBTAINED
BY
COMPARING
THE
TRANSMITTANCE
RECORDED
WHEN
ONLY
ADP
IS
ADDED
TO
PLATELETRICH
PLASMA
PRP
IN
CF
PATIENTS
AND
KNOWN
HETEROZYGOTES
THIS
RATIO
IS
4

9
TIMES
HIGHER
THAN
IN
HEALTHY
SUBJECTS
WE
HAVE
TESTED
PRP
FROM
40
HEALTHY
PEOPLE
25
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
AND
40
KNOWN
HETEROZYGOTES
WE
COULD
DETECT
ALL
CF
PATIENTS
