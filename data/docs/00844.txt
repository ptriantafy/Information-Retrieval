BRONCHOSCOPY
AND
LAVAGE
IN
MANAGEMENT
OF
PULMONARY
COMPLICATIONS
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THIS
ARTICLE
PRESENTS
OUR
EXPERIENCE
WITH
BRONCHOSCOPY
AS
A
THERAPEUTIC
AND
DIAGNOSTIC
TOOL
IN
THE
MANAGEMENT
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
RESULTS
FROM
THERAPEUTIC
BRONCHOSCOPY
AND
BRONCHIAL
IRRIGATION
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
HAVE
BEEN
QUITE
IMPRESSIVE
LEVELS
OF
BLOOD
GAS
AFTER
THE
PROCEDURE
HAVE
GENERALLY
SHOWN
IMPROVEMENT
THE
VITAL
CAPACITY
AND
FEF1
IN
GENERAL
HAVE
SHOWN
SMALL
BUT
CONSISTENT
IMPROVEMENTS
THE
MOST
DRAMATIC
EFFECT
HAS
BEEN
THE
PATIENTS
OWN
ASSESSMENT
OF
THE
OPERATION
THESE
PATIENTS
STATE
THAT
THEIR
BREATHING
IS
LESS
LABORED
IN
THAT
IT
IS
LESS
RAPID
AND
MUCH
DEEPER
BRONCHOSCOPY
OFFERS
AN
EFFECTIVE
THERAPEUTIC
TOOL
IN
THE
MANAGEMENT
OF
PULMONARY
COMPLICATIONS
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
BENEFIT
IS
SHORTLIVED
AND
REPEATED
BRONCHOSCOPIC
PROCEDURES
ARE
OFTEN
NECESSARY
IT
MUST
BE
ACCEPTED
THAT
THERE
IS
A
POINT
IN
TIME
WHEN
THE
CARDIOPULMONARY
STATE
OF
A
PATIENTS
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
MAY
HAVE
PROGRESSED
BEYOND
SALVAGEABLE
LIMITS
IT
IS
OUR
CONVICTION
THAT
EARLIER
BRONCHOSCOPY
AND
THOROUGH
BRONCHIAL
IRRIGATION
MAY
PREVENT
THE
CRITICAL
PULMONARY
EVENT
WHICH
IS
FOLLOWED
INEVITABLY
BY
PROGRESSIVE
DETERIORATION
OF
THE
PULMONARY
STATUS
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
