RELATIVE
UNDERWEIGHT
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
ITS
PROGNOSTIC
VALUE
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
OBSERVATIONS
IN
117
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SEEN
FROM
JANUARY
1956
TO
JUNE
1976
IT
IS
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
THE
RELATIVE
UNDERWEIGHT
WEIGHT
LOSS
CORRECTED
FOR
HEIGHT
IS
MOST
PRONOUNCED
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
PREDOMINANTLY
PULMONARY
SYPMTOMS
THE
DEGREE
OF
UNDERWEIGHT
CLOSELY
CORRELATES
INVERSELY
WITH
SURVIVAL
BECAUSE
OF
ITS
PROGNOSTIC
VALUE
IT
IS
RECOMMENDED
THAT
THIS
CLINICAL
PARAMETER
BE
INCLUDED
IN
THE
CHECKUPS
WHICH
ARE
PERIODICALLY
CARRIED
OUT
ON
CHILDREN
SUFFERING
FROM

FIBROSIS
