KILLING
OF
FIBROBLASTS
BY
DEXAMETHASONE
OR
DIBUTYRYL
ADENOSINE
35MONOPHOSPHATE
IS
NOT
A
VALID
TEST
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ASSAYS
BASED
ON
THE
COUNTING
OF
TOTAL
CELLS
AND
OF
COLONYFORMING
CELLS
WERE
USED
TO
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
NEITHER
DEXAMETHASONE
NOR
DIBUTYRYL
ADENOSINE
35MONOPHOSPHATE
CYCLIC

KILLS
HUMAN
FIBROBLASTS
UNDER
A
VARIETY

THESE
RESULTS
CONTRADICT
THOSE
OF
PREVIOUS
STUDIES
SHOWING
THAT
DEXAMETHASONE
AND
DIBUTYRYL
CYCLIC
AMP
KILL
A
HIGHER
PERCENTAGE
