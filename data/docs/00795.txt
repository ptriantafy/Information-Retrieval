RESEARCH
CORPORATION

IS
INADEQUATE
BECAUSE
IT
PRODUCES
ERRATIC
AND
MISLEADING

THE

WAS
COMPARED
WITH
THE

REPRODUCIBILITY
BETWEEN
RIGHT

IN

IT
HAS
BEEN
COMPARED
EXTENSIVELY
WITH
THE
QUANTITATIVE

BOTH
IN

THERE
IS
EXCELLENT
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
THE
MODIFIED
METHOD

THE
QUANTITATIVE

THERE
APPEARS
TO
BE
A
SLIGHT
BIAS
TOWARD
HIGHER
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
CHLORIDE
FROM
THE
RIGHT

COMPARED
WITH
THE

THIS

IS
NOT
MEDICALLY
SIGNIFICANT
