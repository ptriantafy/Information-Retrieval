SCREENING
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
BY
ANALYSIS
OF
MECONIUM
FOR
ALBUMIN
AND
PROTEASE
INHIBITORS
A
QUALITATIVE
METHOD
OF
DETECTING
ELEVATED
MECONIUM
PROTEIN
CONCENTRATION
WAS
COMPARED
WITH
A
METHOD
OF
DETERMINING
MECONIUM
ALBUMIN
CONCENTRATION
BY
ELECTROIMMUNOASSAY
SINCE
ELEVATED
MECONIUM
PROTEIN
LEVELS
CAN
INDICATE

IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
TO

BY
DETERMINING
THE
