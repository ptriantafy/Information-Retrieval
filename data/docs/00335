STUDIES
ON
IMMUNOGLOBULINS
IN
HEALTHY
CHILDREN
IN
VARIOUS
STAGES
OF
DEVELOPMENT
AND
IN
THE
CHOSEN
ILLNESSES
THE
STUDIES
WERE
CARRIED
OUT
WITH
VIEW
TO
EVALUATE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
IMMUNOGLOBULINS
BIOSYNTHESIS
IN
CHILDREN
FROM
BIRTH
THROUGH
FIRST
YEAR
OF
LIFE
AND
UP
TO
AGE
OF
15
YEARS
AS
WELL
AS
TO
ESTABLISH
THE
NORMAL
VALUES
OF
EACH
IMMUNOGLOBULIN
CLASS
IN
HEALTHY
CHILDREN
OF
DIFFERENT
AGE
IN
OUR
CONDITIONS
OF
INVESTIGATIONS
AND
IN
OUR
GEOGRAFICAL
SOCIAL
AND
ECONOMICAL
SITUATION
THERE
WAS
ALSO
UNDER
CONSIDERATION
THE
EVALUATION
OF
BODY
REACTION
ON
ANTIGENIC
STIMULATION
AND
ADMINISTRATION
OF
GAMMAGLOBULIN
PREPARATIONS
IN
ORDER
TO
DETERMINE
MORE
BROADLY
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THESE
HUMORAL
IMMUNITY
PARAMETERS
IN
CHILDREN
QUALITATIVE
AND
QUANTITATIVE
INVESTIGATIONS
OF
IMMUNOGLOBULINS
WERE
UNDERTAKEN
ALSO
IN
SAME
CHOSEN
ILLNESSES
WHERE
CHANGES
IN
BIOSYNTHESIS
AND
METABOLISM
OF
IMMUNOGLOBULINS
MAY
BE
CONNECTED
WITH
PATHOGENESIS
OF
ILLNESS
OR
WITH
TYPE
OF
TREATMENT
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
ATAXIATELANGIECTASIA
SYNDROME
AT
PITUITARY
DWARFISM
FENYLOKETONURIA
PKU
IN
SOME
GROUPS
OF
CHILDREN
INVESTIGATIONS
WERE
SYSTEMATICALLY
REPEATED
TO
EVALUATE
THE
DYNAMISM
OF
CHANGES
