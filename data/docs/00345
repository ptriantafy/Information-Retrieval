THE
ACTIVITY
OF
AMYLASE
IN
SERUM
WAS
DERIVED
FROM
TWO
GROUPS
OF
ISOENZYMES
ONE
GROUP
ORIGINATING
FROM
THE
SALIVARY
GLANDS
THE
OTHER
FROM
THE
PANCREATIC
GLAND
THE
CONTRIBUTION
OF
EACH
OF
THESE
TWO
SOURCES
TO
THE
TOTAL
SERUM
AMYLASE
WAS
DETERMINED
FROM
EARLY
FOETAL
LIFE
TO
ADULT
AGE
A
VERY
LOW
ACTIVITY
OF
THE
SALIVARY
ISOAMYLASES
WAS
REGULARLY
FOUND
IN
SERUM
FROM
14WEEKOLD
FOETUSES
THE
ACTIVITY
INCREASED
STEADILY
WITH
AGE
AND
REACHED
THE
NORMAL
ADULT
LEVEL
ABOUT
80

AT
THE

5

THE
MAJORITY
OF
CHILDREN
BELOW
3
MONTHS
HAD
NO

THE
ACTIVITY
ROSE
SLOWLY

REACH
ADULT
LEVEL
ABOUT
80
UL
AT
THE
AGE
OF
10

THE
ACTIVITY
DID
NOT
VARY
WITH

THE
DIURNAL
VARIATION

WAS
NEGLIGIBLE
