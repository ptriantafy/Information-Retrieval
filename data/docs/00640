ABNORMAL
BREAKDOWN
OF
ALPHA2MACROGLOBULINTRYPSIN
COMPLEX
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
COMPLEX
OF
TRYPSIN
WITH
PURIFIED
ALPHA2MACROGLOBULIN
FROM
NORMALS
AND
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WAS
STUDIED
THE
FORMED
COMPLEX
FAILED
TO
REVEAL
ANY
PROTEOLYTIC
ACTIVITY
TOWARD
A
HIGH
MOLECULAR
WEIGHT
SUBSTRATE
WHEREAS
THE
ESTEROLYTIC
ACTIVITY
TOWARDS
A
LOW
MOLECULAR
WEIGHT
SUBSTRATE
WAS
RETAINED
THIS
ESTEROLYTIC
ACTIVITY
WAS
RESISTANT
TO
INHIBITION
BY
A
HIGH
MOLECULAR
WEIGHT
INHIBITOR
DURING
IINCUBATION
AT
38
DEGREES
C
THE
COMPLEX
WITH
NORMAL
ALPHA2MACROGLOBULIN
WAS
SLOWLY
INHIBITED
BY
THE
HIGH
MOLECULAR
WEIGHT
INHIBITOR
AND
REGAINED
ACTIVITY
WITH
THE
HIGH
MOLECULAR
WEIGHT
SUBSTRATE
THIS
PHENOMENON
WAS
NOT
OBTAINED
WHEN
THE
ALPHA2
MACROGLOBULIN
FROM
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WAS
EXAMINED
THESE
DATA
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
GRADUAL
CONVERSION
OF
NORMAL
ALPHA2MACROGLOBULINTRYPSIN
COMPLEX
INTO
AN
ALPHA2MACROGLOBULIN
FRAGMENTTRYPSIN

IS
DEFICIENT
