DEFECTS
IN
THE
CELL
CYCLE
OF
FIBROBLASTS

THIS
PAPER
ANALYZES
THE
CELL
CYCLE
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSISDERIVED
FIBROBLASTS
AND
STATISTICALLY
DEMONSTRATES
THEIR
FAILURE
TO
SUPPORT
A
NORMAL
POPULATION
DOUBLING
TIME
IN
VITRO
AND
INDICATES
THAT
THIS
IS
DUE
LARGELY
TO
A
FAILURE
OF
THE
CYSTIC
FIBROSISDERIVED
CELLS
TO
ENTER
THE
CELL
CYCLE
IN
NORMAL
NUMBERS
WE
HAVE
NO
EXPLANATION
FOR
THE
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THESE
CELLS
