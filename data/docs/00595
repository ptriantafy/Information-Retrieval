AN
EVALUATION
OF
THE
SENSORY
INTEGRATIVE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
YOUNG
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
STUDIES
HAVE
SHOWN
THAT
CHILDREN
WITH
CHRONIC
ILLNESSES
ARE
MORE
PRONE
TO
DEVELOP
SECONDARY
HANDICAPS
IN
THE
AREAS
OF
EDUCATIONAL
ACHIEVEMENT
BEHAVIOR
AND
PSYCHOLOGICAL
MALADJUSTMENT
THAN
ARE
NORMAL
CHILDREN
BESIDES
HIS
PHYSICAL
SYMPTOMS
THE
CHILD
WITH
A
CHRONIC
ILLNESS
MUST
ENDURE
PROLONGED
HOSPITALIZATION
PSYCHOLOGICAL
STRESSES
DECREASED
ACTIVITY
AND
IS
OFTEN
DENIED
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
SKILL
PRACTICE
AND
PEER
GROUP
ACTIVITIES
ALL
THESE
FACTORS
RESULT
IN
AN
OVERALL
DECREASE
IN
SENSORY
STIMULATION
WHICH
COULD
IMPAIR
PERCEPTUALMOTOR
FUNCTIONING
AS
WELL
AS
THE
CHILDS
ABILITY
TO
SUCCESSFULLY
ADAPT
TO
HIS
DISEASE
THEREFORE
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
RESEARCH
WAS
TO
OBTAIN
A
GENERAL
IDEA
OF
THE
PERCEPTUALMOTOR
OR
SENSORY
INTEGRATIVE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
CHILDREN
WITH
CF
TO
DETERMINE
IF
THERE
IS
IN
FACT
A
NEED
FOR
SENSORY
INTEGRATIVE
TREATMENT
IN
THE
CARE
OF
THESE
CHILDREN
