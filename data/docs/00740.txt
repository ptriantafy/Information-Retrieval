WE
HAVE
ATTEMPTED
TO
REPRODUCE
THE
ISOELECTRIC
FOCUSING

POLYACRYLAMIDE

IEFAG
METHOD
SPECIFIED
BY
WILSON
ET
AL
IN
OUR
LABORATORY
SINCE
THE
RESOLUTION
OBTAINED
WITH
THEIR
PROCEDURE
APPEARED
TO
BE
INADEQUATE
FOR
IDENTIFYING
SINGLE
PROTEIN
BANDS
IN
THE
RELEVANT
REGION
WE
HAVE
INCORPORATED
SEVERAL
METHODOLOGIC
IMPROVEMENTS
INTO
THE
ISOELECTRIC
FOCUSING
TECHNIQUE
THESE
IMPROVEMENTS
HAVE
SIGNIFICANTLY
ENHANCED
THE
RESOLUTION
AND
HAVE
THUS
ENABLED
US
TO
DEMONSTRATE
A
GREATER
DEGREE
OF
HETEROGENEITY
OF
SERUM
GAMMAGLOBULINS
THAN
IS
VISIBLE
IN
THE
PAPER
OF
WILSON
ET
AL
DESPITE
THE
SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE
IN
THE
NUMBER
OF
BANDS
RESOLVED
BY
OUR
METHOD
A

COULD
NOT
BE
DETECTED
IN
ADDITION
THE
TWOSTEP
IEFAGDISC
ELECTROPHORESIS
TECHNIQUE
OF
ALTLAND
ET
AL
HAS
BEEN
TESTED
IN
OUR
LABORATORY
WE
HAVE
ALSO
MODIFIED
THIS
ANALYTIC
PROCEDURE
ENABLING
THE
FRACTIONATION
OF
SEVERAL
SMALL
PROTEINS
FROM
A
PORTION
OF
THE
IGG
FRACTION

DESPITE
AN
IMPROVEMENT
IN

WHICH
REVEALS
MORE
HETEROGENEITY
NO

HAS
BEEN
OBSERVED
