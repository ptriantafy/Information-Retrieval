MUCOCILIARY
CLEARANCE
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IF
WE
ARE
TO
FULLY
UNDERSTAND
THE
FACTORS
WHICH
CONTROL
MUCOCILIARY
CLEARANCE
THROUGHOUT
THE
HUMAN
LUNG
AND
THE
INTERRELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN
CLEARANCE
AND
DISEASE
IT
WILL
BE
NECESSARY
TO
MEASURE
MUCOCILIARY
CLEARANCE
RATES
IN
AIRWAYS
AT
ALL
LEVELS
WITHIN
THE
LUNG
DURING
THE
PAST
FEW
YEARS
TECHNICAL
MEANS
HAVE
BEEN
SOUGHT
WHEREBY
THE
RATES
OF
MUCUS
CLEARANCE
WITHIN
INDIVIDUAL
AIRWAYS
CAN
BE
MEASURED
IN
THIS
LABORATORY
WE
HAVE
DEVELOPED
A
RELATIVELY
NONINVASIVE
TECHNIQUE
FOR
MEASURING
MUCOCILIARY
TRACHEAL
TRANSPORT
RATES
WE
MEASURED
MTTRS
IN
20
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
MTTRS
DID
NOT
CORRELATE
WELL
WITH
THE
DEGREE
OF
PULMONARY
DISEASE
IN
THESE
PATIENTS
THE
MEASUREMENTS
OF
MTTR
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
A
DERANGED
MUCOCILIARY
CLEARANCE
MECHANISM
IS
NOT
A
NECESSARY
CONDITION
FOR
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
WE
HAVE
ALSO
BEEN
INTERESTED
IN
EVALUATING
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
THE
THERAPY
USED
IN
THE
TREATMENT
OF
CF
