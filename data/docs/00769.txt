THE
PRESENT
STUDY
WAS
INITIATED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
ANTIBODY
RESPONSE
TO
LIPOPROTEIN
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
VARIOUS
ENTEROBACTERIAL
INFECTIONS
THIS
INVESTIGATION
WAS
ALSO
CONSIDERED
IMPORTANT
BECAUSE
PATIENTS
WITH
THESE
INFECTIONS
RESPOND
DIFFERENTLY
TO
ANOTHER
ANTIGEN
COMMON
TO
ENTEROBACTERIACEAE
