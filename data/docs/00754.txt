IMAGING
TECHNIQUE
FOR
MEASURING
THE
RATE
OF

IN
THE

WAS
USED
TO

GRAVITATIONAL
EFFECTS
ON

CLEARANCE
IN
13

NINE
OF
THE

DEMONSTRATED
ABNORMAL
TRACHEAL

CLEARANCE
WHICH
APPROACHED

WHEN
THEY
WERE
PLACED
IN
25
DEGREES
HEADDOWN
POSITION
THE
NORMAL
SUBJECTS
AND
TWO
OF
THE

PATIENTS
SHOWED
NO
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
RT
MEASURED
IN
THE
TWO
POSITIONS
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
STUDY
INDICATE
THAT
THE
FORCE
OF
GRAVITY
CAN
BE
A
MAJOR
INFLUENCE
ON
TRACHEAL
MUCUS
CLEARANCE
IN

THIS
CONCLUSION
SUPPORTS
THE
USE
OF
POSTURAL
DRAINAGE
AS
AN
EFFECTIVE
FORM
OF
THERAPY
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
