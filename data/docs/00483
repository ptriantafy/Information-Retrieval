FALSENEGATIVE
MECONIUM
TESTS
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
TWO
REVIEWS
HAVE
QUESTIONED
THE
VALUE
OF
MECONIUM
TESTS
FOR
THE
ROUTINE
SCREENING
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
HIGH
PROPORTION
OF
FALSEPOSITIVE
AND
PERHAPS
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
FALSENEGATIVE
RESULTS
WE
WISH
TO
REPORT
OUR
FINDINGS
ON
FALSENEGATIVE
RESULTS
WE
ARE
EVALUATING
VARIOUS
METHODS
OF
MECONIUM
SCREENING
INCLUDING
THE
BOEHRINGER
MANNHEIM
TEST
STRIP
A
SEMIQUANTITATIVE
TEST
FOR
PROTEINS
ELECTROIMMUNOASSAY
OF
ALBUMIN
AND
ESTIMATION
OF
THE
ALBUMINALPHA1ANTIRYPSIN
RATIO
THE
FIGURES
ARE
TOO
SMALL
TO
DRAW
ANY
CONCLUSIONS
BETWEEN
THE
APPARENT
RELATIONSHIP
OF
FALSENEGATIVE
RESULTS
AND
A
FAMILY
HISTORY
OF
THE
DISEASE
BUT
WE
FEEL
THAT
THE
RESULTS
ILLUSTRATE
THAT
LITTLE
RELIANCE
SHOULD
BE
PUT
ON
A
NEGATIVE
MECONIUM
TEST
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
MECONIUM
TEST
IS
VALUELESS
IN
OUR
STUDY
AT
LEAST
40
OF
INFANTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAD
A
POSITIVE
MECONIUMTEST
RESULT
BUT
DID
NOT
HAVE
MECONIUM
ILEUS
AND
THUS
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IN
THESE
INFANTS
WAS
RECOGNISED
WITHIN
A
FEW
DAYS
AFTER
BIRTH
AND
USUALLY
WELL
BEFORE
DEFINITIVE
CLINICAL
SIGNS
OF
THE
DISEASE
WERE
MANIFEST
