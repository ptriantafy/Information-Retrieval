THE
PURPOSE
HERE
WAS
TO
TEST
FOR
A
GENERALIZED
ABNORMAL
SENSITIVITY
OF
THE
EXTERNAL
CHEMORECEPTIVE
SYSTEMS
USING
A
STANDARDIZED
METHOD
THAT
SEPARATES
SENSORY
ACTIVITY
FROM
BIASING
FACTORS
KNOWN
TO
AFFECT
MEASUREMENT
OF
SENSITIVITY
THE
FREQUENCY
DISTRIBUTIONS
OF
SALT
TASTE
SENSITIVITY
FOR
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ARE
GIVEN
NORMAL
SIBLINGS
AND
CONTROL
PATIENTS
DID
NOT
DIFFER
STATISTICALLY
AND
THEY
WERE
COMBINED
INTO
A
SINGLE
CONTROL
GROUP
FOR
ANALYSES
THE
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
DID
NOT
DIFFER
AS
A
GROUP
FROM
THE
NORMAL
SUBJECTS
IN
SALT
SENSITIVITY
THERE
WERE
HOWEVER
TWO
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WITH
TASTE
SENSITIVITIES
WELL
BELOW
THOSE
OBSERVED
AMONG
THE
NORMAL
CHILDREN
NO
AGE
OR
SEX
DIFFERENCES
IN
SENSITIVITY
WERE
OBSERVED
THE
TASTE
SENSITIVITY
OF
THE
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
DID
NOT
CORRELATE
WITH
THE
SHWACHMAN
AND
KULCZYCKI
RATING
OF
THE
SEVERITY
OF
THEIR
DISEASE
OF
THE
SEVEN
CHILDREN
WHO
HAD
DETERMINATIONS
OF
SWEAT
ELECTROLYTES
AT
THE
TIME
OF
TASTE
TESTING
THREE
FAILED
TO
EXCRETE
SUFFICIENT
AMOUNTS
FOR
MEASUREMENTS
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AS
A
GROUP
WERE
NOT
FOUND
TO
HAVE
MORE
SENSITIVE
TASTE
ACUITY
THAN
NORMAL
THIS
CORROBORATES
THE
FINDINGS
OF
WOTMAN
AND
ASSOCIATES
AND
STRONGLY
SUGGESTS
THAT
A
GENERAL
ABNORMALITY
OF
THE
TASTE
SYSTEM
IS
NOT
ROUTINELY
SYMPTOMATIC
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HENKIN
AND
POWELL
HYPOTHESIZED
THAT
EXTREMELY
ACUTE
TASTE
IS
RELATED
TO
ELEVATIONS
IN
THE
CONCENTRATION
OF
ELECTROLYTES
IN
SWEAT
THIS
SEEMS
UNLIKELY
SINCE
THE
PATIENTS
GIVEN
SWEAT
TESTS
IN
THE
PRESENT
STUDY
ALL
HAD
THE
HIGH
LEVELS
OF
SODIUM
AND
CHLORIDE
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
YET
ALL
HAD
TASTE
SENSITIVITIES
IN
THE
NORMAL
RANGE
WOTMAN
AND
ASSOCIATES
SUGGESTED
THAT
PERHAPS
THE
SEVERITY
OF
THE
DISEASE
ACCOUNTS
FOR
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
HYPERSENSITIVITY
IN
THE
CHEMORECEPTIVE
SYSTEMS
THE
CLINICAL
RATINGS
OF
THE
SEVERITY

DID
NOT
