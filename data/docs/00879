ELEVEN
YEAR
SURVEY
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
COMMUNICATION
IS
TO
REVIEW
OUR
EXPERIENCES
WITH
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SEEN
FROM
JANUARY
1964
TO
JANUARY
1975
AND
TO
ANALYSE
THE
FACTORS
WHICH
HAVE
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
IMPROVED
PROGNOSIS
WHICH
HAS
OCCURRED
IN
THIS
PERIOD
THE
NUMBERS
OF
NEW
PATIENTS
HAVE
INCREASED
FROM
SIX
IN
1964
TO
12
IN
1974
BOTH
SEXES
HAVE
BEEN
EQUALLY
AFFECTED
RESPIRATORY
INFECTIONS
FAILURE
TO
THRIVE
AND
DIARRHOEA
WERE
THE
PREDOMINANT
PRESENTING
FEATURES
IN
THAT
ORDER
AND
THUS
ANY
ONE
OF
THESE
PRESENTING
FEATURES
SHOULD
INDICATE
THAT
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SHOULD
AT
LEAST
BE
CONSIDERED
AND
EXCLUDED
EACH
PATIENT
WAS
ASSESSED
MONTHLY
AT
THE
CLINIC
DURING
WHICH
ATTENDANCE
FORMAL
PHYSIOTHERAPY
WAS
CARRIED
OUT
AND
THE
PARENTS
WERE
INSTRUCTED
IN
THE
TECHNIQUES
OF
PERCUSSION
AND
DRAINAGE
FORTYTWO
OF
OUR
SIXTYFOUR
PATIENTS
ARE
STILL
ALIVE
AND
THIRTYTHREE
OF
THOSE
FALL
INTO
THE
EXCELLENT
CATEGORY
SEVEN
INTO
THE
GOOD
AND
ONE
EACH
INTO
THE
FAIR
AND
POOR
DURING
THE
PERIOD
OF
THIS
REVIEW
THERE
HAS
BEEN
AN
OBVIOUS
IMPROVEMENT
WITH
A
FALL
IN
MORBIDITY
AND
MORTALITY
AND
WITH
THE
INCREASING
PROPORTION
OF
PATIENTS
NOW
IN
THE
EXCELLENT
GROUP
WE
ATTRIBUTE
THESE
FACTS
TO
EARLIER
DIAGNOSIS
REGULAR
AND
CAREFUL
FOLLOWUP
AND
A
SUPERVISED
THERAPEUTIC
PROGRAMME
INCLUDING
PARENT
EDUCATION
AND
PARTICIPATION
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THEREFORE
THAT
EARLY
DIAGNOSIS
AND
ACTIVE
TREATMENT
PROLONG
LIFE
AND
GIVE
BETTER
HEALTH
