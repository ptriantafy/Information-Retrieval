THE

37
CASES
OF

FIBROSIS
OF
THE

FROM

NONCONSECUTIVE
NECROPSIES
ARE
PRESENTED
ALL
OF
THESE
37
CASES
WERE
DIAGNOSED
AT

THE

INCIDENCE
WAS

NONE
OF
THE
CASES
WAS
BEYOND

THIS

SUGGESTS
THAT
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PLAYS
A
CONSIDERABLE
ROLE
IN
INFANT
DEATHS
IN
OUR
COUNTRY
AND
IN
MOST
IF
NOT
ALL
CASES
THE
DIAGNOSIS
MUST
NECESSARILY
BE
BASED
ON
