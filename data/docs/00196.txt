CLEARANCE
DATA
OBTAINED
BY
OUR
GROUP
IN
RELATIVELY
HEALTHY
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SUBJECTS
WAS
NOT
AFFECTED
BY
COUGH
THE
MAJORITY
OF
SUBJECTS
MENTIONED
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
ARTICLE
DID
NOT
COUGH
DURING
THE
STUDY
AND
INDEED
WERE
CHOSEN
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
RELATIVELY
HEALTHY
AT
THE
TIME
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
TO
STUDY
THEM
OVER
FAIRLY
LONG
PERIODS
WITHOUT
INTERFERENCE
FROM
COUGH
AND
THUS
THE
RELATIVELY
NORMAL
CLEARANCE
TIMES
DEMONSTRATED
WERE
PRESUMABLY
DUE
TO
MUCOCILIARY
TRANSPORT
REFERENCE
WAS
MADE
TO
NASAL
MUCOCILIARY
CLEARANCE
STUDIES
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
NORMAL
SUBJECTS
WHICH
INDICATED
THAT
CLEARANCE
WAS
SIMILAR
IN
BOTH
GROUPS
UNTIL
MILD
INFLAMMATION
OF
THE
NASAL
MUCOSA
WAS
PRODUCED
WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THE
WORK
WAS
PERFORMED
IN
OUR
LABORATORY
SINCE
NO
REFERENCE
WAS
GIVEN
IN
THE
DISCUSSION
