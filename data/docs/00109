LETTER
WRINKLING
OF
SKIN
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
I
HAVE
OBSERVED
THAT
THE
SKIN
OF
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WRINKLES
EXCESSIVELY
EARLY
WHEN
SOAKED
IN
TAP
WATER
THIS
PHYSICAL
SIGN
IS
HIGHLY
RELIABLE
IRRESPECTIVE
OF
THE
DEGREE
OF
NUTRITION
OF
THE
PATIENT
IT
IS
SOMETIMES
SEEN
IN
INFANTS
WITH
MARASMUS
NORMAL
SKIN
WRINKLES
EVENTUALLY
TO
EXPOSURE
TO
WATER
EXCEPT
THAT
FROM
THE
DEAD
SEA
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
DISORDER
OF
SALT
FLUX
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
CONNECTED
WITH
THE
APPARENT
EXCESSIVE
HYPERTONIC
REACTIVITY
OF
THE
SKIN
THREE
MINUTES
AND
A
BOWL
OF
WATER
MIGHT
PROVIDE
A
CHEAP
SCREENING
TEST
FOR
THIS
CONDITION
