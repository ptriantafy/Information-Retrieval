THIS

A
TEST
WAS
DEVELOPED
TO
DETECT
SCA
IN
BIOLOGIC
FLUIDS
BY
MEANS
OF
A
NATURAL
VIBRATILE
SYSTEM
IT
CONSISTED
IN
THE
INCUBATION
OF
MOUSE
SPERM
WITH
DIFFERENT

UNDER
CONTROLLED

AS
THE

WERE

TO

HAVE

IT
WAS

THIS

EMPLOYED
AS

SIGNIFICANT

WERE
FOUND

IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
MOUSE

IS
A
SYSTEM
SENSITIVE
ENOUGH
TO
DETECT
SCA
IN
BIOLOGIC
FLUIDS
FROM
HUMAN

LIKEWISE
THE

ALLOWED
US
TO
DETECT
