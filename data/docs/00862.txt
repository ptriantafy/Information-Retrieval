ASSAYED
USING
4
METHYLUMBELLIFERYLGUANIDINOBENZOATE
AN
ACTIVE
SITE
TITRANT
OF
CERTAIN
PROTEASES
IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
DEFICIENT
IN
PLASMA
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
DEFICIENCY
CAN
BE
DEMONSTRATED
WITH
BOTH
CHLOROFORMELLAGIC
ACID
ACTIVATED
PLASMA
IN
WHICH
THE
PROTEASES
CAN
HYDROLYZE
ESTERS
OF
ARGININE
AND
UNACTIVATED
PLASMA
IN
WHICH
THE
PROTEASES
HAVE
NEGLIGIBLE
ACTIVITY
TOWARDS
THESE
ESTERS
THE
DEFICIENCY
CAN
ALSO
BE
DEMONSTRATED
BY
SEPARATION
OF
THE
PROTEASES
BY
ISOELECTRIC
FOCUSING
ON
POLYACRYLAMIDE
GELS
OR
BY
CHROMATOGRAPHY
ON
AGAROSE
COLUMSN
SINCE
PROTEASE
DEFICIENCY
CAN
BE
DEMONSTRATED
WITH
UNACTIVATED
PLASMA
THE
DEFICIENCY
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
PROBABLY
DUE
TO
A
REDUCED
NUMBER
OF
PROTEASE
MOLECULES
RATHER
THAN
THEIR
DECREASED
CATALYTIC
EFFICIENCY
