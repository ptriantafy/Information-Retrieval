LETTER
THE
OTHERWISE
EXCELLENT
ARTICLE
ON
BRONCHIECTASIS
AND
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
BY
DR
MARGARET
HODSON
IS
SERIOUSLY
MARRED
BY
THE
FAILURE
TO
EMPHASISE
THAT
THE
ADVICE
ON
MANAGEMENT
AND
DRUG
DOSAGE
IS
DIRECTED
THROUGHOUT
TO
THE
ADULT
AND
ADOLESCENT
AND
NOT
TO
THE
CHILD
FIRSTLY
TETRACYCLINE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
PRESCRIBED
FOR
YOUNG
CHILDREN
FOR
OBVIOUS
REASONS
SECONDLY
THE
DOSAGE
OF
ALL
ANTIBIOTICS
RECOMMENDED
IS
HIGH
FOR
INFANTS
AND
SMALL
CHILDREN
THE
FINAL
PARAGRAPH
GIVES
A
PESSIMISTIC
IMPRESSION
OF
AN
UNDOUBTEDLY
DISTRESSING
CONDITION
BY
STRESSING
THE
EARLY
MORTALITY
OF
THE
PAST
AND
OF
MANY
OF
THE
OLDER
PATIENTS
OF
TODAY
WITHOUT
NOTING
THE
EFFECT
THAT
EARLY
DIAGNOSIS

PERHAPS
AS
A
RESULT
OF
NEONATAL
SCREENING

TOGETHER
WITH
MORE
EFFECTIVE
TREATMENT
MAY
HAVE
IN
THE
FUTURE
ON
THE
QUALITY
OF
LIFE
AND
LENGTH
OF
LIFE
