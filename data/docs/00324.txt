THE
SENSITIVITY
OF
THE
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
FELL
WITHIN
THE
NORMAL
RANGE
THESE
RESULTS
STAND
IN
CONTRAST
TO
THOSE
OF
HENKIN
AND
POWELL
WHO
FOUND
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
TO
BE
HYPERSENSITIVE

BOTH
OLFACTORY
AND
TASTE
STIMULI
APPARENT
HYPERSENSITIVITY
TO
TASTE

HAVE
RESULTED
FROM
THE

THE
RELATIVELY
HIGH
LEVEL
OF
SODIUM
IN
THE

A

THRESHOLD
IDENTICAL
TO
THAT
OF

THERE
APPEARS
TO
BE
NO
SIMPLE
EXPLANATION
FOR
WHY
HENKIN
AND
POWELL
FOUND
HYPERSENSITIVITY
TO
ODORANTS
THE
PRESENT
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
IN
FACT
CHILDREN

DISPLAY
A

HYPOSENSITIVITY
TO
ODORANTS
