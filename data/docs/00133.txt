THE
USE
OF
MEDIUMCHAIN
TRIGLYCERIDE
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
INTESTINAL
MALABSORPTION
MEDIUMCHAIN
TRIGLYCERIDES
MCT
ARE
FATS
IN
WHICH
THE
CHAIN
LENGTH
IS
SIX
TO
TWELVE
CARBON
ATOMS
THIS
IS
IN
CONTRAST
TO
THE
MORE
USUAL
DIETARY
SOURCES
OF
FATS
LONGCHAIN
TRIGLYCERIDES
LCT
WHICH
CONTAIN
MORE
THAN
14
CARBON
ATOMS
IN
THEIR
ATOMIC
CHAIN
THE
DIFFERENCES
IN
CHEMICAL
STRUCTURE
BETWEEN
LCT
AND
MCT
ARE
IMPORTANT
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
RELATED
TO
MAJOR
DIFFERENCES
IN
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
ABSORPTION
AND
METABOLISM
OF
THESE
TWO
CLASSES
OF
LIPIDS
THESE
PHYSIOLOGICAL
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
LCT
AND
MCT
HAVE
LED
TO
THE
USE
OF
MCT
IN
VARIOUS
DISORDERS
WHERE
MALABSORPTION
OF
LCT
OCCURS
BUT
WHERE
MCT
CAN
BE
ABSORBED
BECAUSE
THEY
BYPASS
SEVERAL
OF
THE
STEPS
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
ABSORPTION
OF
LONG
CHAIN
FATS
THESE
INCLUDE
PANCREATIC
DISEASE
CHRONIC
LIVER
DISEASE
DISORDERS
OF
THE
BILIARY
TRACT
AND
DISEASES
OF
THE
SMALL
INTESTINAL
EPITHELIUM
AND
LYMPHATIC
VESSELS
THE
COMMENTS
WHICH
FOLLOW
ARE
A
BRIEF
SUMMARY
OF
THE
THERAPEUTIC
PLACE
OF
MCT
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
MALABSORPTION
THIS
WILL
BE
FOLLOWED
BY
SOME
REMARKS
ABOUT
THE
POTENTIAL
VALUE
OF
MCT
IN
COUNTRIES
LIKE
INDONESIA
WHERE
THE
COMMONEST
CAUSE
OF
CHRONIC
DIARRHOEA
AND
MALABSORPTION
IN
CHILDREN
IS
MALNUTRITION
AND
CHRONIC
AND
REPEATED
GASTROINTESTINAL
INFECTIONS
AND
INFESTATIONS
AND
WHERE
MCT
HAS
NOT
BEEN
USED
WIDELY
