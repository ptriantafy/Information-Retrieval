FIBROBLASTS
FROM
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
ARE
MORE
RESISTANT
TO
DEXAMETHASONE
TOXICITY
THAN
ARE
NORMAL
CELLS
WE
NOW
REPORT
THAT
WHEN
FIBROBLASTS
CULTURED
FROM
OBLIGATE
CF
HETEROZYGOTES
ARE
EXPOSED
TO
DEXAMETHASONE
THEY
HAVE
AN
INTERMEDIATE
SURVIVAL
COMPARED
TO
NORMAL
AND
HOMOZYGOUS
CF
CELLS
WHEN
DEXAMETHASONE

WAS
TESTED
ON
CELLS
FROM
FOUR

UNDERGOING
AMNIOCENTESIS

FROM
A
WOMAN
AT
RISK
OF

A

SHOWED
SIGNIFICANT
DEXAMETHASONE

OF

THESE
DATA
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
DEXAMETHASONE
RESISTANCE
PREVIOUSLY
OBSERVED
IN

MAY
ALSO
BE
USEFUL
IN
