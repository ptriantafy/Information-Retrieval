TRACT
OF
CHILDREN
WITH

AND
CHILDREN
WITH

THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
SEROLOGICAL
TYPES
OF
D
PNEUMONIAE
WAS
INVESTIGATED
IN
40
STRAINS
ISOLATED
FROM
26
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
57
STRAINS
ISOLATED
FROM
39
CHILDREN
WITH
OTHER
DISEASES
ALL
STRAINS
WERE
ISOLATED
FROM
SPUTUM
OR
TRACHEAL
SECRETION
THE
STRAINS
FROM
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
BELONGED
TO
14
DIFFERENT
SEROLOGICAL
TYPES
THE
MOST
PREVALENT
WERE
19F
19A
AND
3
THE
STRAINS
FROM
THE
OTHER
GROUP
OF
CHILDREN
BELONGED
TO
20
DIFFERENT
SEROLOGICAL
TYPES
THE
MOST
PREVALENT
WERE
23F
19F
AND
11A
THE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
GROUPS
OF
PATIENTS
AS
TO
THE
PREVALENCES
OF
TYPES
WERE
SMALL
AND
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
NO
SPECIAL
SEROLOGICAL
TYPES
OF
D
PNEUMONIAE
ARE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
