GENTAMYCIN
WHEN
USED
WITH
OTHER
ANTIBIOTICS
IN
PULMONARY
INFECTIONS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
FROM
1971
TO
1973
WE
HOSPITALIZED
41
SYMPTOMATIC
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
FOR
INTENSIVE
PULMONARY
THERAPY
THE
MORE

PATIENTS
WERE
ADMITTED

DURING
THIS
PERIOD
OUR
STUDY

100

THE
PURPOSE
OF

WAS
TO
EVALUATE
THE
TOLERANCE

OF
GARAMYCIN
WHEN
ADMINISTERED
PARENTERALLY

THE
USE
OF
GARAMYCIN
PEDIATRIC
INJECTABLE
IS
SAFE
AND
CAN
BE
HELPFUL
IN
THE
MANAGEMENT
OF
