PABATEST
FOR
DIAGNOSIS
OF
EXOCRINE
PANCREATIC
INSUFFICIENCY
LETTER
WE
HAVE
ALSO
FOUND
A
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
6HOUR
URINARY
PABA
RECOVERY
IN
HEALTHY
CONTROLS
AND
CF
PATIENTS
WITH
NO
OVERLAP
OF
THE
RANGES
AND
A
GOOD
CORRELATION
WITH
FECAL
CHYMOTRYPSIN
ACTIVITY
WE
CAN
STRESS
THE
USEFULNESS
OF
THE
TEST
IN
THIS
AGE
GROUP
IN
STUDYING
A
GROUP
OF
HEALTHY
NEWBORN
INFANTS
HOWEVER
THE
RESULTS
WERE
QUITE
DIFFERENT
THE
PABA
RECOVERY
WAS
SMALLER
AND
SHOWED
GREATER
VARIATIONS
AND
OVERLAP
WITH
RESULTS
IN
CF
PATIENTS
OCCURRED
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
THE
TEST
IS
NOT
APPLICABLE
IN
NEWBORN
INFANTS
WHEN
PERFORMED
IN
THE
DESCRIBED
MANNER
ONE
POSSIBLE
EXPLANATION
IS
THE
PHYSIOLOGICALLY
LIMITED
GLOMERULAR
FILTRATION
RATE
IN
THE
NEWBORN
INFANT
WHICH
COULD
HAVE
DELAYED
THE
PABA
EXCRETION
