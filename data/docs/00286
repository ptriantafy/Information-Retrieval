ESSENTIALFATTYACID
METABOLISM
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
6
PATIENTS
WITH
PROVEN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
A
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
SCHWACHMAN
CLINICAL
SCORES
WERE
STUDIED
AND
THE
CONTROLS
WERE
10
HEALTHY
CHILDREN
UNDERGOING
MINOR
ELECTIVE
SURGICAL
PROCEDURES
THE
RESULTS
SHOW
THAT
FOR
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THERE
ARE
NOT
ONLY
DECREASED
PROPORTIONS
OF
ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACIDS
BUT
THAT
203
OMEGA9
IS
FOUND
IN
ALL
CASES
OUR
RESULTS
SUGGEST
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
INTRINSIC
DEFECT
OF
THE
DESATURATING
SYSTEM
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
THAT
THE
PATTERN
OF
ESSENTIALFATTYACID
DEFICIENCY
IS
ENTIRELY
SIMILAR
TO
THAT
FOUND
IN
DIETARY
DEFICIENCY
OF
ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACIDS
A
FURTHER
SIGNIFICANT
FINDING
IS
THE
OCCURANCE
IF
203
OMEGA9
IN
APPARENTLY
HEALTHY
CHILDREN
PARTICULARLY
THE
VERY
YOUNG
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
DIETRELATED
AND
EMPHASISES
THE
YOUNG
CHILDS
VERY
LARGE
REQUIREMENT
FOR
ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACIDS
FOR
MEMBRANE
SYNTHESIS
THE
NEED
FOR
ADEQUATE
POLYUNSATURATED
FATTY
ACIDS
IN
CHILDHOOD
CANNOT
BE
OVERSTATED
WHETHER
THEY
BE
FOR
NORMAL
MEMBRANE
SYNTHESIS
OR
LOWERING
OF
SERUMLIPIDS
GIVING
POSSIBLE
PROTECTION
AGAINST
CARDIOVASCULAR
DISEASE
