PATTERN
THE
INCORPORATION
OF

TO
GLYCOPROTEIN
ACCEPTORS
PREPARED
FROM
THE
SALIVA
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF

WAS
COMPARED
WITH
THE
INCORPORATION
INTO

THE

GLYCOPROTEIN
INCORPORATED
SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE

ACTIVITY
IN
THE
PATIENTS
PLASMA
WAS
NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
CONTROLS
FUCOSIDASE
ACTIVITY
WAS
SIMILAR
ALSO
FOR
BOTH
GROUPS
THE

BANDS
OF
THE
ACCEPTOR
GLYCOPROTEINS
FROM
THE

SALIVA
DIFFERED
FROM
THOSE

IN
NUMBER
AND
ELECTROPHORETIC
MOBILITY
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THESE

WE
PROPOSE
THAT

QUALITATIVELY
DIFFERENT
