WE
DESCRIBE
A
NEW
METHOD
FOR
MEASURING
PANCREATIC
AND
SALIVARYTYPE
AMYLASES
IN
SERUM
THAT
REQUIRES
NO
ELECTROPHORESIS
OR
CHROMATOGRAPHY

PANCREATIC
AMYLASE
WAS
USED
TO
ANALYZE
MIXTURES
OF
THE
TWO
ENZYMES
THE
CONCENTRATION
OF
PANCREATIC

AMYALASE
WAS
DETERMINED
IN
141

SERA
72
MEN
AND
69

STATISTICALLY
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES
WERE
FOUND
FOR

BETWEEN

NO

WAS
FOUND
FOR

WITH
THIS
METHOD
THE
INCREASE
IN
SERUM
AMYLASE
ACTIVITY
IN

WAS
SHOWN
TO
BE
ATTRIBUTABLE
