CF
COMPARED
TO

ARE
ALWAYS
MORE
SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER
THAN
ARACHIDONIC
ACID
AA
SIMILARLY
THE

LOWERING
IS
ALSO
MORE

THERE
IS

BOTH

ALL
OF
OUR
CF
PATIENTS
HAVE
SHOWN
THIS
ACID
AT
SOME
STAGE
AND
FOR
MOST
IT
IS
A
PERMANENT
FEATURE
OF
THEIR
FATTY
ACID
PROFILE
IT
HAS
BEEN
REPORTED
THAT
C203OMEGA9
WOULD
PROBABLY
ACT
AS
AN
INHIBITOR
OF
PROSTAGLANDIN
FORMATION
FROM
AA
AND
IT
IS
INTERESTING
TO
CONJECTURE
ON
WHETHER
THIS
COULD
ACCOUNT
FOR
SOME
OF
THE
SYMPTOMS
OF
CF
C203OMEGA9
WOULD
ALSO
BE
INCORPORATED
INTO
PI
AND
COULD
THEN
ALTER
