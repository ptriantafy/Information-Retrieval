WE
ARE
PUZZLED
BY
CERTAIN
UNUSUAL
PHENOMENA
IN
THE
TWO
CASES
PRESENTED
WE
AGREE
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
IMPORTANT
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
OCCURRENCE

WE

WE
CAN
FURTHER
UNDERSTAND
THE

THESE
TWO

PATIENTS

WE
DO
NOT
THINK
THERE
WAS
HYPOVOLEMIA

EITHER

PATIENT

ONLY
ONE

ACETAMINOPHEN

THE

IT
IS
IN
MOST
CASES

ALTHOUGH
IT
WAS
MENTIONED

THE
DISCUSSION
THAT
THE
TRANSIENT
NATURE
