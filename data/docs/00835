PASSED
BY
A

INFANT
THE
FIRST
STOOL
BEING
PASSED

THIS
PAPER
WILL
REVIEW
CURRENT
KNOWLEDGE
ON
THE
SOURCES
OF
MECONIUM
AND
ITS
COMPOSITION
IN
HEALTH
AND
DISEASE
STATES
THE
PRECISE
ORIGIN
OF
THE
COMPONENTS
OF
MECONIUM
HAS
NOT
BEEN
DEFINED
THE
QUALITATIVE
AND
QUANTITATIVE
PATTERNS
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
CONSTITUENTS
OF
MECONIUM
IN

MECONIUM
FROM
INFANTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAS
BEEN
MORE
EXTENSIVELY
STUDIED
THAN
IN
ANY
OTHER
DISEASE
AND
THE
PAPER
CONCENTRATES
ON
THIS
ENTITY
THE
COMPOSITION
OF
MECONIUM
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SCREENING
TESTS
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
DIAGNOSIS
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
