A
PRELIMINARY
CLINICAL
STUDY
THE
ORAL
CONDITIONS
OF
42
PATIENTS
BEING
TREATED
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WERE
EVALUATED
THE
PATIENTS
WERE
GROUPED
BY
AGE
AND
IN
SOME
ASPECTS
WERE
COMPARED
WITH
A
SMALL
CONTROL
GROUP
OF
THEIR
SIBLINGS
THE
PATIENT
GROUP
HAD
A
LOWERED

DID

THE
REASONS
FOR
THE
FINDING
OF
MINIMAL

IN
THE
PATIENT
GROUP
COULD
BE
RELATED
TO
SEVERAL
FACTORS
INCLUDING
THE
LIFELONG
USE
OF
VARIOUS
ANTIBIOTIC
AGENTS
THE
CHEWING
OF

IT
APPEARS
THAT
THE

FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WAS
BENEFICIAL
TO
THE
