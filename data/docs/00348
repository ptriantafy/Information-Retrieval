THE

OF
36
PATIENTS

OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAVE
BEEN
STUDIED
TO

THE

PATHOLOGICAL
CHANGES
IN
THE
PULMONARY
CIRCULATION
AND
THE
CLINICAL
FEATURES
THE
PRESENCE
AND
DEGREE
OF

WERE
MEASURED
BY

TECHNIQUE
OF
WEIGHING

SUBJECTS
WHO
DIED
AFTER

OF
3
YEARS
ONE
IN
SIX
HAD
NO
RVH
ALTHOUGH
THE

OF
THIS
GROUP
WAS
NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THAT
OF
THE

THERE
WAS
NO
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
DURATION
OF

THE
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM

USEFUL
IN
THE

VENTRICULAR
HYPERTROPHY
WAS
COMMON
IN

HAS
BEEN
DEMONSTRATED
ONLY
IN
THE
SMALLER

SUBINTIMAL
FIBROSIS
IS
MORE
