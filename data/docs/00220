ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACID
DEFICIENCY
DUE
TO
ARTIFICIAL
DIET
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WE
WISH
TO
DRAW
THE
ATTENTION
OF
YOUR
READERS
TO
A
POSSIBLE
HAZARD
OF
FEEDING
INFANTS
WITH
AN
ELEMENTAL
DIET
CONSIDERABLE
INTEREST
IS
CURRENTLY
BEING
SHOWN
IN
THE
USE
OF
THE
ARTIFICIAL
DIET
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IT
MAY
BE
USED
AS
A
SUPPLEMENT
TO
ORDINARY
FOOD
OR
TO
SUPPLY
ALL
THE
NUTRITIONAL
NEEDS
OF
THE
CHILD
IN
THE
LATTER
EVENT
WE
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
IS
PARTICULARLY
IMPORTANT
TO
EMPHASIZE
TO
THE
PARENTS
THE
NEED
FOR
AN
ADDITIONAL
SOURCE
OF
DIETARY
FAT
CLINICAL
EVIDENCE
AND
ANIMAL
EXPERIMENTS
SUGGEST
THAT
INFANTS
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
RAPID
GROWTH
RATE
ARE
PARTICULARLY
AT
RISK
AND
THAT
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
DIETARY
EFA
THEY
WILL
DEVELOP
DEFICIENCY
SYMPTOMS
IN
ABOUT
TWO
MONTHS
