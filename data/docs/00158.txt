ANALYSIS
OF
ALBUMIN
IN
MECONIUM
FOR
EARLY
DETECTION
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
A
METHODOLOGICAL
STUDY
ALBUMIN
IN
MECONIUM
WAS
QUANTITATED
BY
MEANS
OF
A
SINGLE
RADIAL
IMMUNODIFFUSION
TECHNIQUE
WHICH
IS
DESCRIBED
IN
DETAIL
THE
METHOD
SHOWS
GOOD
PRECISION
AND
ACCURACY
FOR
THIS
MATERIAL
WHEN
CERTAIN
CONDITIONS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
COLLECTION
PREPARATION
AND
ANALYSIS
ARE
OBSERVED
THE
METHOD
CAN
DISCRIMINATE
BETWEEN
HEALTHY
NEWBORNS
AND
NEWBORNS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
