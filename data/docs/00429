FIBROSIS
A
QUANTITATIVE
STUDY
INCLUDING
PREVALENCE
OF
PATHOLOGIC
FINDINGS
AMONG
DIFFERENT
AGE
GROUPS
THE
AUTOPSIES
OF
82
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WERE
REVIEWED
WITH
RESPECT
TO
PATHOLOGIC
CHANGES
IN
THE
LUNGS
AND
THEIR
RESPECTIVE
PREVALENCE
AMONG
DIFFERENT
AGE
GROUPS
ALTHOUGH
BRONCHITIS
MUCOPURULENT
PLUGGING
AND
BRONCHOPNEUMONIA
WERE
ALMOST
UNIVERSALLY
PRESENT
AMONG
CHILDREN
OF
ALL
AGES
EPITHELIAL
METAPLASIA
AND
BRONCHIECTASIS
WERE
RARER
AMONG
INFANTS
AND
PROGRESSIVELY
MORE
PREVALENT
IN
OLDER
AGE
GROUPS
EMPHYSEMA
WAS
ABSENT
IN
PATIENTS
UNDER
TWO
YEARS
OF

AND
AFFECTED
11
PER
CENT
OF
THE
PATIENTS
TWO

SIX
YEARS
OF
AGE
AND
40
PER

OF
THE

A
SEVERE

HEMORRHAGE
ALTHOUGH
UNCOMMON
WAS
USUALLY
ASSOCIATED

QUANTITATIVE
ASSESSMENT
OF

GLANDS
REVEALED
REID
INDICES
SIGNIFICANTLY
HIGHER
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WHEN
COMPARED
TO
NONCYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
INCREASE
IN
THESE
INDICES
WITH
THE

GLANDULAR

MUCOUS

ALL
SUGGEST
AN
EXPLANATION
FOR
THE
COPIOUS
MUCOUS
SECRETION
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HOWEVER
IT
WAS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
ASCERTAIN
WHETHER
THESE
FINDINGS
REFLECT
A
GENERAL
EXOCRINE
DEFECT
OF
SUCH
PATIENTS
OR
WHETHER
THEY
WERE
MERELY
A
RESPONSE
TO
CHRONIC
AIRWAY
INFECTION
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
LATTER
IS
A
MORE
PLAUSIBLE
ASSUMPTION
