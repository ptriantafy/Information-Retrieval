FATTYACID
OXIDATION
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
METABOLIC
DEFECT
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
IS
UNKNOWN
WE
THEREFORE
UNDERTOOK
TO
STUDY
FATTYACID
OXIDATION
BETAOXIDATION
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
THERE
WAS
NO
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
IN
CONTROLS
AND
EITHER
AFFECTED
INDIVIDUALS
OR
HETEROZYGOUS
CARRIERS
ALL
THE
VALUES
IN
THE
AFFECTED
INDIVIDUALS
LAY
WITHIN
THE
NORMAL
RANGE
UNLESS
FOR
SOME
SPECIAL
REASON
THE
DEFECT
IS
NOT
EXPRESSED
IN
LEUKOCYTES
THESE
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
THE
METABOLIC
PATHWAY
INVOLVED
IN
FATTYACID
OXIDATION
BETAOXIDATION
IS
INTACT
IN
CF
IT
THEREFORE
SEEMS
UNLIKELY
THAT
THE
REPORTED
DEFICIENCY
OF
CERTAIN
ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACIDS
IN
CF
IS
THE
RESULT
OF
A
DEFECT
IN
FATTYACID
METABOLISM
