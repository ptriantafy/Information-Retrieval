FIBROSIS
TWO
MAJOR
CLASSES
OF
LIPOPROTEINS
LOW
DENSITY
AND
HIGH
DENSITY
ARE
DECREASED
IN
THE
SERUM
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
MAJOR
APOPROTEINS
ARE
ALSO
DECREASED
SINCE
ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACIDS
AND
CERTAIN
FATSOLUBLE
VITAMINS
DEPEND
ON
LIPOPROTEINS
FOR

KNOWLEDGE
OF
LIPOPROTEIN
LEVELS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
COULD
PROVE
VALUABLE

THE
BASIS
