AMINOGLYCOSIDE
CLEARANCE
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
LETTER
WE
HAVE
BEEN
UTILIZING
A
PATIENTS
INDIVIDUAL
PHARMACOKINETIC
PROFILE
TO
PLAN
AND
MONITOR
AMINOGLYCOSIDE
THERAPY
AND
WE
HAVE
OFTEN
NOTED
WHAT
APPEARED
TO
BE
AN
EXTREMELY
RAPID
ELIMINATION
RATE
OF
GENTAMICIN
IN
OUR
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAD
SIGNIFICANTLY
GREATER
RENAL
AND
TOTAL
CLEARANCES
THAN
THOSE
WITHOUT
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IF
THIS
OBSERVATION
COULD
BE
EXTENDED
TO
OTHER
DRUGS
SUCH
AS
THE
AMINOGLYCOSIDES
WHICH
ARE
NOT
NORMALLY
SUBJECT
TO
RENAL
SECRETION
IT
WOULD
PROVE
INTRIGUING
EVIDENCE
FOR
A
POSSIBLE
PRIMARY
RENAL
DEFECT
IN
THESE
PATIENTS
