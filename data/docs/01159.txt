PROSTAGLANDINS
AND
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WE
HAVE
INVESTIGATED
TWO
ASPECTS
OF
PROSTAGLANDIN
FUNCTION
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
RESPONSE
OF
PLATELETS
TO
PGE1
AND
THE
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
PGE2
AND
PGEALPHA
IN
THE
SWEAT
LOW
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
PGE1
HAVE
LESS
EFFECT
ON
PLATELET
AGGLUTINATION
IN
CF
PATIENTS
AND
HETEROZYGOTES
THAN
IN
NORMALS
BUT
NO
DIFFERENCE
IS
OBSERVED
WHEN
HIGH
PG
CONCENTRATIONS
ARE
USED
SWEAT
PGE2
AND
PGEALPHA
CONCENTRATIONS
ARE
SIMILAR
IN
NORMALS
CF
PATIENTS
AND
HETEROZYGOTES
BUT
SWEAT
PGE2
CONCENTRATIONS
ARE
PROPORTIONAL
TO
NACL
LEVELS
IN
CF
BUT
NOT
IN
CONTROL
CHILDREN
OR
HETEROZYGOTES
