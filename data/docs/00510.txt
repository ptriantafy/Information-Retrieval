CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAS
ATTRACTED
THE
ATTENTION
OF
BIOMEDICAL
INVESTIGATORS
BECAUSE
IT
IS
THE
MOST
PREVALENT
CHRONIC
DISEASE
INHERITED
IN
CAUCASIAN
CHILDREN
CARRIERS

OCCUR
QUITE
FREQUENTLY
IN
THE
CAUCASIAN
POPULATION
A
MAJOR
AIM
IN
RESEARCH
ON
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
TEST
THAT
WILL
OFFER
RELIABLE
DETECTION
OF
THE
HETEROZYGOTE
AND
OF
THE
FETUS
WITH

FIBROSIS
CONSIDERABLE
NUMBERS
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
THIS
DISEASE
ARE
NOT
DIAGNOSED
UNTIL
AFTER
DEATH
THE
THERAPY
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
STILL
SYMPTOMATIC
AND
