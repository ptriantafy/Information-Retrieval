IN
A
PREVIOUS
COMMUNICATION
WRITTEN
IN
RESPONSE
TO
A
LETTER
BY
SMITH
ET
AL
WE
SUGGESTED
SEVERAL
POSSIBLE
REASONS
FOR
THE
INABILITY
OF
THOMAS
ET
AL
AND
OTHER
INVESTIGATORS
TO
DETECT
CYSTIC

TECHNIQUES
THOMAS
AND
COWORKERS
COMMUNICATED
WITH
US
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
DETERMINING
POSSIBLE
REASONS
FOR
THEIR
INABILITY
TO
DETECT
CFP
BY
ELECTROFOCUSING
KEY
POINTS
MADE
DURING
THESE
CONVERSATIONS
ARE
REITERATED
BELOW
IN
A
FIRM
ATTEMPT
TO
ALLEVIATE
FUTURE
PROBLEMS
BY
INEXPERIENCED
INVESTIGATORS
IN
THEIR
ATTEMPTS
TO
USE
ANALYTIC
ELECTROFOCUSING
TO
DETECT
CFP
IN
OUR
COMMUNICATIONS
WITH
THOMAS
AND
COWORKERS
WE
LEARNED
THAT
DESPITE
OUR
SUGGESTIONS
THEY
HAD
NOT
ANALYZED
THE
SAMPLES
THEY
SCREENED
BY
EITHER
USING
THE
EQUIPMENT
OF
AWDEH
ET
AL
OR
EMPLOYING
OUR
STANDARDIZED
PROCEDURE
IT
IS
UNKNOWN
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
EXERCISED
THE
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
SERUM
SAMPLE
COLLECTION
PROCESSING
AND
STORAGE
WE
FEEL
THE
ABOVE
REASONS
ARE
SUFFICIENT
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
REPORTED
FAILURE
OF
THOMAS
ET
AL
TO
REPRODUCE
OUR
RESULTS
AND
TO
DETECT
CONSISTENTLY
A
CFP

SERA
