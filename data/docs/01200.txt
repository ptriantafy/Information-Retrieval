EVIDENCE
AGAINST
A
SPECIFIC
EFFECT
OF
SERUM
FROM
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ON
SODIUMDEPENDENT
GLUCOSE
TRANSPORT
IN
THE
RAT
JEJUNUM
SERA
FROM
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
OF
THE
PANCREAS
CF
AND
NORMAL
HUMAN
SERA
WERE
ASSAYED
FOR
THE
ABILITY
TO
INHIBIT
SODIUM
DEPENDENT
GLUCOSE
TRANSPORT
IN
RAT
BRUSHBORDER
MEMBRANE
VESICLES
FRESH
CF
AND
AGE
AND
SEXMATCHED
CONTROL
SERA
WERE
BOTH
INHIBITORY
WHEN
COMPARED
TO
PHYSIOLOGIC
SALINE
THE
INHIBITION
BY
CF
SERUM
WAS
44

SD
AT
A
FINAL
SERUM
CONCENTRATION
OF
67
67

34
AT
10
SERUM
AND
68

28
AT
20
SERUM
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
INHIBITION
OF
CF
SERA
COMPARED
TO
THAT
OF
CONTROL
SERA
WAS
100
078
AND
093
AT
67
10
AND
20
SERUM
CONCENTRATIONS
RESPECTIVELY
ALTHOUGH
A
SLIGHTLY
GREATER
INHIBITION
BY
CF
SERUM
WAS
OBSERVED
AT
A
CONCENTRATION
OF
10
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
NOT
SIGNIFICANT
BECAUSE
NO
DIFFERENCE
COULD
BE
DETECTED
AT
A
CONCENTRATION
OF
20
SERUM
GLUCOSE
TRANSPORT
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
SERUM
WAS
SENSITIVE
TO
PHLORIZIN
INDICATING
THAT
THE
RESIDUAL
GLUCOSE
TRANSPORT
WAS
PROCEEDING
BY
THE
SODIUMDEPENDENT
GLUCOSE
TRANSPORT
SYSTEM
THESE
FINDINGS
SUGGEST
THAT
CF
SERUM
DOES
NOT
SPECIFICALLY
INHIBIT
THE
SODIUMDEPENDENT
GLUCOSE
TRANSPORT
SYSTEM
THE
INTRAVESICULAR
SPACE
ACCESSIBLE
TO
GLUCOSE
WAS
REDUCED
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
CF
OR
CONTROL
SERUM
FRESH
CF
SERUM
WAS
14
TIMES
MORE
EFFECTIVE
THAN
FRESH
CONTROL
SERUM
P
LESS
THAN
001
THE
PRESENCE
OF
SUBSTANTIAL
VESICLE
SHRINKING
ACTIVITY
IN
CONTROL
SERUM
INDICATES
THAT
THIS
ACTIVITY
CANNOT
BE
CONSIDERED
SPECIFIC
FOR
CF
