NOCTURNAL
ELEMENTAL
DIET
FOR
RETARDED
GROWTH
IN
A
PATIENT
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
COMBINATION
OF
CHRONIC
PULMONARY
SEPSIS
AND
PANCREATIC
INSUFFICIENCY
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
MAY
LEAD
TO
MALNUTRITION
WE
DESCRIBE
OUR
EXPERIENCE
OF
THE
LONGTERM
USE
OF
CONTINUOUS
NOCTURNAL
INFUSION
OF
ELEMENTAL
DIET
IN
A
PATIENT
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
OUR
PATIENT
TOLERATED
THE
LONGTERM
NOCTURNAL
ELEMENTAL
DIET
WELL
AND
IT
ENABLED
HER
TO
CONTINUE
NORMAL
EVERYDAY
ACTIVITY
AND
EAT
NORMAL
MEALS
THE
PERIODS
OF
NUTRITIONAL
SUPPORT
COINCIDED
WITH
PERIODS
OF
INCREASED
BODY
WEIGHT
AND
TOTAL
BODY
POTASSIUM
INDICATING
THAT
THE
LEAN
BODY
MASS
WAS
INCREASED
WE
THINK
THAT
THESE
RESULTS
SHOW
A
NEED
FOR
FURTHER
STUDIES
OF
HOME
TREATMENT
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
