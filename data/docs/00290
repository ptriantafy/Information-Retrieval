PROPOSE
THAT
THE
SUBNORMAL
LEVELS
OF
LINOLEIC
ACID
182
FOUND
IN
THE
PLASMAPHOSPHOLIPIDS
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ARE
DUE
TO
MALABSORPTION
TO
SUBSTANTIATE
THEIR
HYPOTHESIS
THEY
DEDUCE
THAT
THE
REMARKABLE
REMISSION
OBSERVED
IN
A
CYSTICFIBROSIS
PATIENT
GIVEN
INTRAVENOUS
INTRALIPID
WAS
DUE
NOT
TO
THE
182
CONTENT
OF
THE
20
TRIGLYCERIDE
COMPONENT
OF
THE
FAT
EMULSION
BUT
TO
THE
204
CONTENT
OF
ITS
12
PHOSPHOLIPID
COMPONENT
NOT
6
AS
THEY
STATE
THIS
EXPLANATION
SEEMS
UNLIKELY
IN
VIEW
OF
THE
RELATIVELY
SMALL
PROPORTION
OF
204
IN
INTRALIPID
PHOSPHOLIPID
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
INTRAVENOUS
ADMINISTRATION
OF
INTRALIPID
PHOSPHOLIPID
TO
HEALTHY
SUBJECTS
DECREASES
BOTH
THE
182
AND
204
CONTENT
OF
THEIR
PLASMAPHOSPHOLIPIDS
COMPARISON
OF
THE
EFFECTS
OF
COMPLETE
INTRALIPID
VERSUS
INTRALIPID
PHOSPHOLIPID
ON
THE
LEVEL
OF
204
IN
THE
PLASMAPHOSPHOLIPIDS
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WOULD
SOON
DETERMINE
WHETHER
THEY
LACK
THE
ABILITY
TO
DESATURATE
182
TO
204
