IN
OUR

15

AT

TAKING
HIGHER
THAN
THE

14
OF
THESE
15
CHILDREN
WERE
HYPERURICOSURIC
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THIS
INFORMATION
WE
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
MINIMAL
EFFECTIVE
DOSE
OF
PANCREATIC
EXTRACT
SHOULD
BE
DETERMINED
AND
ADHERED
TO
FOR
EACH
CHILD
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
TO
AVOID
POTENTIAL
