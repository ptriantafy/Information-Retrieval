POLYAMINES
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
POLYAMINE
CONCENTRATIONS
HAVE
BEEN
MEASURED
IN
BLOOD
SAMPLES
FROM
A
SERIES
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
PATIENTS
AND
CONTROL
SUBJECTS
ANALYSES
WERE
MADE
BY
A
FLUOROMETRIC
METHOD
IN
WHICH
THE
AMINES
WERE
REACTED
WITH
DANSYL
CHLORIDE
AND
SEPARATED
BY
THIN
LAYER
CHROMATOGRAPHY
ON
KIESELGUHR
THERE
WAS
NO
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
POLYAMINE
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
BLOOD
SAMPLES
FROM
CF
PATIENTS
AND
CONTROL
SUBJECTS
ALSO
THE
SPERMIDINESPERMINE
RATIO
WAS
SIMILAR
IN
BOTH
GROUPS
POLYAMINES
WERE
ALSO
ANALYZED
IN
EXOCRINE
FLUIDS
AND
ALTHOUGH
NONE
COULD
BE
DETECTED
IN
EITHER
CF
OR
CONTROL
SWEAT
OR
SALIVA
SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNTS
OF
SPERMINE
AND
SPERMIDINE
WERE
PRESENT
IN
ALL
SAMPLES
OF
BILE
AND
DUODENAL
FLUIDS
IT
THUS
SEEMS
LIKELY
THAT
THE
BILIARY
ROUTE
IS
A
SIGNIFICANT
PATHWAY
IN
THE
HUMAN
FOR
EXCRETION
OF
POLYAMINES
THE
OBSERVATION
THAT
POLYAMINES
ARE
EXCRETED
IN
CONSIDERABLE
CONCENTRATIONS
VIA
THE
BILE
IN
CHILDREN
MAY
BE
OF
INTEREST
IN
VIEW
OF
THE
REPORTS
OF
ELEVATED
URINARY
POLYAMINE
CONCENTRATIONS
IN
NEOPLASTIC
STATES
SINCE
MEASURABLE
AMOUNTS
OF
SPERMINE
AND
SPERMIDINE
WERE
DETECTED
IN
ALL
SIX
BILE
PREPARATIONS
AVAILABLE
FOR
THIS
STUDY
ANALYSIS
OF
THESE
SUBSTANCES
IN
BILE
MAY
BE
OF
BENEFIT
IN
PARTICULAR
CASES
