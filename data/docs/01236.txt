REVIEW
OF
INVESTIGATIONS
OF
THE
MUCOCILIARY
INHIBITOR
RECENTLY
WE
FOUND
THE
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
MUCOCILIARY
INHIBITOR
IN
URINE
FROM
HOMOZYGOTES
AND
HETEROZYGOTES
BUT
NOT
FROM
NORMALS
IN
RECENT
STUDIES
WE
HAVE
ATTEMPTED
TO
COMPARE
THE
RELATIVE
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
CFMI
IN
MATERIAL
FROM
HOMOZYGOTES
AND
HETEROZYGOTES
THE
UNITES
OF
INHIBITION
WHICH
REFLECT
THE
CONCENTRATION
OF
THE
CFMI
IN
SERUM
AND
TISSUE
CULTURE
MEDIUM
FRACTIONS
FROM
HETEROZYGOTES
IS
CLOSE
TO
ONEHALF
OF
THAT
IN
FRACTIONS
FROM
HOMOZYGOUS
SOURCES
WITH
PURIFICATION
OF
THE
CFMI
AND
THE
GENERATION
OF
A
MONOSPECIFIC
ANTIBODY
PREPARATION
ANSWERS
WILL
BECOME
AVAILABLE
TO
THE
QUESTIONS
OF
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THERE
IS
A
NORMAL
COUNTERPART
TO
THE
CFMI
AND
WHETHER
OR
NOT
QUANTITATION
OF
THE
CFMI
WILL
BE
USEFUL
IN
HETEROZYGOTE
