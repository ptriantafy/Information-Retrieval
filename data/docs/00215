CLASSIFICATION
OF
HEREDITARY
DISORDERS
OF
SEXUAL
DEVELOPMENT
WE
HAVE
RECENTLY
PROPOSED
A
CLASSIFICATION
OF
THE
DISORDERS
OF
SEXUAL
DEVELOPMENT
BASED
UPON
THE
PRESUMED
SITE
OF
ACTION
OF
THE
ABNORMAL
GENE
DURING
EMBRYOGENESIS
THESE
DISORDERS
WHICH
MAY
BE
EITHER
GENETIC
OR
NONGENETIC
IN
NATURE
ARE
THE
RESULT
OF
DISTURBANCES
IN
THE
PHYSIOLOGY
OF
SEXUAL
DIFFERENTIATION
DURING
EMBRYOGENESIS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
REVIEW
IS
TO
SUMMARIZE
THE
CURRENT
PHYSIOLOGIC
CONCEPTS
OF
NORMAL
SEXUAL
DIFFERENTIATION
TO
REVIEW
THE
KNOWN
HEREDITARY
DISORDERS
OF
SEXUAL
DEVELOPMENT
AND
TO
CONSIDER
BRIEFLY
THE
IMPLICATIONS
THAT
THESE
MUTATIONS
HAVE
FOR
THE
UNDERSTANDING
OF
NORMAL
SEXUAL
DIFFERENTIATION
THE
TRANSLATION
OF
GENETIC
SEX
INTO
PHENOTYPIC
SEX
IS
A
COMPLEX
PROCESS
SINCE
SOME
19
HEREDITARY
SINGLEGENE
DETERMINED
DISORDERS
OF
SEXUAL
DEVELOPMENT
ARE
CURRENTLY
RECOGNIZED
THAT
INVOLVE
LOCI
ON
BOTH
THE
AUTOSOMES
AND
THE
X
CHROMOSOME
IT
CAN
BE
INFERRED
THAT
AT
A
MINIMUM
19
GENES
AND
HENCE
19
DISCRETE
BIOCHEMICAL
STEPS
ARE
INVOLVED
IN
THIS
PROCESS
AT
LEAST
10
MUTATIONS
RESULT
IN
MALE
PSEUDOHERMAPHRODITISM
WHEREAS
ONLY
2
MUTATIONS
ARE
KNOWN
TO
CAUSE
FEMALE
PSEUDOHERMAPHRODITISM
THE
PREDOMINANCE
OF
MALE
TYPE
OF
MUTATION
IS
THE
RESULT
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
FORMATION
OF
THE
MALE
PHENOTYPE
IS
ACTIVELY
INDUCED
BY
THE
SECRETIONS
OF
THE
FETAL
TESTIS
WHEREAS
THE
FORMATION
OF
THE
FEMALE
PHENOTYPE
DOES
NOT
REQUIRE
SECRETION
FROM
THE
FETAL
OVARY
THE
END
RESULT
OF
THESE
MUTATIONS
THAT
INVOLVE
THE
FORMATION
AND
ACTION
OF
TESTOSTERONE
CAN
BE
SIMILAR
AND
IT
REQUIRES
ANATOMIC
ENDOCRINOLOGIC
AND
GENETIC
STUDY
OF
INDIVIDUAL
PATIENTS
TO
IDENTIFY
THE
MUTANT
GENES
INVOLVED
UNDOUBTEDLY
MANY
MORE
AS
YET
UNIDENTIFIED
GENES
MUST
PARTICIPATE
IN
SEXUAL
DIFFERENTIATION
THE
IDENTIFICATION
OF
THESE
GENES
WILL
DEPEND
ON
THE
CONTINUED
DELINEATION
OF
NEW
SIMPLY
INHERITED
CLINICAL
SYNDROMES
ANY
FUNDAMENTAL
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
PROGRAMMING
OF
EVENTS
IN
PHENOTYPIC
DIFFERENTIATION
WILL
REQUIRE
NOT
ONLY
THE
IDENTIFICATION
OF
THE
GENES
INVOLVED
BUT
THE
ELUCIDATION
OF
THE
MOLECULAR
MECHANISMS
BY
WHICH
EACH
OF
THESE
GENES
IS
EXPRESSED
