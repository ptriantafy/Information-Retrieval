THE
PRESENT
INVESTIGATION
WAS
DESIGNED
TO
ASSESS
THE
ABSORPTION
AND
DISPOSITION
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
OF
TWO
COMMONLY
USED
ANTIBIOTICS
AN
AMINOPENICILLIN
EPICILLIN
AND
A
CEPHALEXIN
OSPEXIN
THE
PHARMACOKINETIC
PARAMETERS
OF
EPICILLIN
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
AND
THEIR
NORMAL
CONTROLS
DIFFER
IN
A
NUMBER
OF
ASPECTS
THE
DIFFERENCE
FOUND
IN
THE
MAXIMAL
PLASMA
CONCENTRATIONS
COULD
BE
ACCOUNTED
FOR
BY
A
MANIFOLD
INCREASE
IN
THE
RENAL
CLEARANCE
OF
THE
DRUG
OUR
DATA
SUPPORT
THE
IDEA
THAT
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
EXHIBIT
AN
UNUSUALLY
LARGE
AND
RAPID
RENAL
CLEARANCE
OF
CERTAIN
PENICILLINS
