PROFESSOR
ELLIOTT
AND
DR
NORMAN
AND
HIS
COLLEAGUES
SUGGESTED
THAT
EXCESSIVE
WRINKLING
OF
THE
SKIN
AFTER
SOAKING

WATER
MIGHT
PROVIDE
AN
EASY
CHEAP
AND
PROBABLY
RELIABLE
SCREENING
TEST
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS

RESULTS
SHOW
THAT
THIS
NOT

OBSERVED

RANDOMLY
SELECTED

HEART
ENDOCRINE

EVEN

HEALTHY
INDIVIDUALS
BOTH
YOUNG
AND
ADULT
