MANAGEMENT
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
EDITORIAL
CONTROVERSY
STILL
SURROUNDS
THE
MOST
APPROPRIATE
METHOD
OF
MANAGEMENT
OF
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
REASON
FOR
MUCH
OF
THE
UNCERTAINTY
ABOUT
MANAGEMENT
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
THAT
MANY
THERAPEUTIC
APPROACHES
HAVE
BEEN
PROPOSED
WITHOUT
PROPERLY
CONDUCTED
CONTROLLED
TRIALS
WITH
THE
CURRENT
APPROACHES
TO
THERAPY
AT
LEAST
80
OF
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CAN
EXPECT
TO
REACH
ADULT
LIFE
MOST
WITH
MINIMAL
OR
NO
LUNG
DAMAGE
HOWEVER
THIS
DRAMATIC
IMPROVEMENT
IN
SURVIVAL
DOES
NOT
INDICATE
THAT
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
NOW
AN
EASY
CONDITION
TO
MANAGE
AND
THAT
IT
NO
LONGER
REQUIRES
SPECIALISED
CARE
