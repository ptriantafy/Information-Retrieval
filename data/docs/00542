QUESTIONS
REGARDING
ARGININE
HYDROCHLORIDE
INHALATION
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
RECENT
STUDY
OF
DIETZSCH
ET
AL
ON
THE
USE
OF
ARGININE
HYDROCHLORIDE
INHALATION
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
I
WISH
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THESE
INVESTIGATORS
ACTED
IRRESPONSIBLY
IN
EXPOSING
THEIR
PATIENTS
FOR
AN
APPRECIABLE
PERIOD
SEVEN
WEEKS
TO
A
PREPARATION
WHICH
IS
KNOWN
TO
BE
IRRITATING
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
DELETERIOUS
EFFECTS
SEEN
BY
DIETZSCH
ET
AL
ARE
DUE
TO
THEIR
INATTENTION
TO
EXPERIMENTAL
DETAIL
AND
LACK
OF
COMMUNICATION
WITH
OTHER
INVESTIGATORS

DIETZSCH
ET
AL
GIVE
THE
IMPRESSION
IN
THEIR
ARTICLE
THAT
ALL
ARGININE
SOLUTION
ARE
DETRIMENTAL
TO
THE
LUNG
WE
WISH
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
LARGININE
HYDROCHLORIDE
BUFFERED
WITH
A
SODIUM
SOLUTION
IS
IRRITATIVE
TO
THE
AIRWAY
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
HOWEVER
NO
COMPARISON
STUDIES
WERE
DONE
WITH
LARGININE
BUFFERED
WITH
FREE
BASE

THE
FATE
OF
THESE
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
DEPENDS
ON
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
INHALATION
TREATMENT
THIS
MEANS
IF
YOU
REPLACE
A
GOOD
MUCOLYTIC
DRUG
WITH
A
BETTER
ONE
YOU
STEP
BY
STEP
APPROACH
THE
IDEAL
MUCOLYTIC
SOLUTION
WE
THINK
IT
TO
BE
UNETHICAL
TO
USE
OTHER
LESS
EFFECTIVE
DRUGS
OR
SOLUTIONS
IN
A
CONTROL
GROUP
EG
SALINE
OR
DISTILLED
WATER
WE
DID
NOT
STATE
THAT
ARGININE
SOLUTIONS
ARE
IRRITATIVE
OR
THAT
ARGININE
TREATMENT
IS
DANGEROUS
THE
NACETYLCYSTEINE
SOLUTION
WHICH
WAS
SUCCESSFULLY
USED
BEFORE
THE
TREATMENT
OF
OUR
PATIENTS
WAS
BUFFERED
WITH
SODIUM
HYDROXIDE
TO
A
PH
OF
70
THE
QUANTITY
OF
SODIUM
WHICH
WAS
ADMINISTERED
DURING
EACH
INHALATION
AMOUNTS
TO
ONLY
004
MVAL
OF
SODIUM
SO
THAT
AN
INJURIOUS
PHARMACOLOGICAL
EFFECT
CAN
BE
EXCLUDED
BOTH
DRUGS
WERE
WELL
TOLERATED
AND
HAD
NO
DELETERIOUS
EFFECTS
