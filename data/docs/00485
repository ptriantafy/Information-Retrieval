THE

MAY
BE
OF
GREAT
SIGNIFICANCE
TO
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
AETIOLOGY
AND
PATHOGENESIS
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
AND
ACCORDS
WITH
OUR
OBSERVATIONS
THAT
ALLERGIC
SYMPTOMS
AND
POSITIVE
SKIN
TESTS
ARE
MORE
COMMON
IN
CF
HOMOZYGOTES
THAN
IN
HEALTHY
CONTROLS
APART
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
59
OF
OUR
CF
HOMOZYGOTES
GAVE
A
POSITIVE
SKIN
TEST
TO
ONE
OR
MORE
OF
40
DIFFERENT
CLASSES

HETEROZYGOTES

A
STRONG

HISTORY

ALLERGY

HER
MATERNAL

THE

BETWEEN
THE
