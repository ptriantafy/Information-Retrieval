WE
HAVE
DEVELOPED
AN
IMPROVED
METHOD
FOR
THE
DETECTION
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PROTEIN
CFP
THE
METHOD
EMPLOYS
THE
LKB
MULTIPHOR
TO
ELECTROFOCUS
WHOLE
SERUM
INSTEAD
OF
THE
APPARATUS
USED
IN
PREVIOUS
STUDIES
TWO
BASIC
MODIFICATIONS
WERE
NECESSARY
1
A
PH
25100
GRADIENT
INSTEAD
OF
A
PH
510
GRADIENT
AND
2
CONSTANT
POWER
FOR
FOCUSING
THE
SERUM
PROTEINS
INSTEAD
OF
CONSTANT
VOLTAGE
THE
FIRST
MODIFICATION
ENSURED
ADEQUATE
DISSOLUTION
OF
THE
CFPIGG
COMPLEXES
OR
OTHER
PRECURSOR
COMPLEXES
WHICH
MAY
LIBERATE
CFP
THE
SECOND
MODIFICATION
ENSURED
A
LINEAR
GRADIENT
BETWEEN
PH
38
AND
PH
92
EXCELLENT
RESOLUTION
IN
THE
PH
89
REGION
AND
THE
SEPARATION
OF
CFP
WITHIN
2
HR
WITHOUT
OVERHEATING
OF
THE
GEL
ELECTROFOCUSING
WITH
THE
LKB
MULTIPHOR
PERMITS
THE
DETECTION
OF
CFP
IN
AS
MANY
AS
24
SERUM
SAMPLES
PER

OBTAINED
FROM
THE

INDICATE
THAT

CAN
BE

AND
ACCURATELY
DETECTED
