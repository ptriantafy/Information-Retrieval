A
CRITICAL
REVIEW
OF
TECHNIQUES
CURRENTLY
EMPLOYED
METHODS
FOR
THE
ASSAY
OF
ELECTROLYTES
IN
SWEAT
RELEVANT
TO
THE
DIAGNOSIS
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ARE
CRITICALLY
EVALUATED
WITH
PARTICULAR
REFERENCE
TO
THE
MEASUREMENT
OF
ELECTRICAL
CONDUCTIVITY
ATTENTION
IS
DRAWN
TO
THE
FACTORS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
POTENTIALLY
LARGE
ERRORS
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
EXPERIMENTATION
SUPPORTED
BY
LABORATORY
PRACTICE
RECOMMENDATIONS
ARE
MADE
FOR
THE
REDUCTION
OF
THESE
ERRORS
TO
CLINICALLY
ACCEPTABLE
LEVELS
