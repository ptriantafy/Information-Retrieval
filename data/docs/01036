DYING
CHILDREN
NEED
HELP
TOO
THE
CONTROL
OF
SYMPTOMS
IN
DYING
CHILDREN
IS
OFTEN
SADLY
NEGLECTED
THIS
NEGLECT
IS
REFLECTED
IN
A
REVIEW
OF
THE
CASE
NOTES
OF
TWO
CHILDREN
WHO
DIED
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WITHIN
THREE
YEARS
OF
EACH
OTHER
THE
GIRLS
WERE
UNDER
THE
CARE
OF
THE
SAME
CONSULTANT
WHO
IN
THE
INTERVAL
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
CASES
WAS
INTRODUCED
TO
THE
CONCEPT
OF
PROPER
TERMINAL
CARE
FOR
CHILDREN
THESE
TWO
CASES
SHOW
THAT
ILLNESS
CAN
CAUSE
PHYSICAL
EMOTIONAL
AND
SPIRITUAL
PAIN
TO
FAMILY
AND
STAFF
IN
RETROSPECT
THESE
AREAS
OF
DISTRESS
WERE
NOT
CLEARLY
DEFINED
IN
EITHER
CASE
AND
OPPORTUNITIES
TO
ALLEVIATE
SUFFERING
WERE
MISSED
THE
PRINCIPLES
OF
CONTROLLING
SYMPTOMS
NEED
TO
BE
REMEMBERED
AS
MUCH
DURING
DISTRESSING
TREATMENT
AS
DURING
THE
DISTRESS
OF
DYING
