THE
LEVELS
OF
GENTAMICIN
IN
BLOOD
AND
IN
SECRETIONS
OF
THE
TRACHEOBRONCHIAL
TREE
WERE
MEASURED
IN
14
CHILDREN
8
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
6
WITH
TRACHEOSTOMY
IN
A

HIGH
LEVELS
OF
GENTAMICIN
GREATER
THAN
20
MUGML
WITHIN
THE
BRONCHIAL
SECRETIONS
WERE
OBSERVED
IN

IN

LEVELS
WERE
LOW
LESS
THAN
3
MUGML
IN
ALL
PATIENTS
AND
NO
DETECTABLE
LEVELS
WERE
FOUND
IN
10
CHILDREN
AFTER
AEROSOLIZATION
AND
IN
6
CHILDREN
AFTER
ENDOTRACHEAL
INSTILLATION
NO
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES
WERE
OBSERVED
BETWEEN
CHILDREN
WITH

SINCE
INTRAMUSCULAR
INJECTION
OF

2
MUGML
IN
10
PATIENTS
AMONG
WHOM
4
HAD
UNDETECTABLE

IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
ADMINISTRATION
OF
AN
ANTIBIOTIC
SUCH
AS
GENTAMICIN
DIRECTLY
TO
THE
TRACHEA
BY
ENDOTRACHEAL
INJECTION

BY
AEROSOLIZATION
MIGHT
PROVE
TO
