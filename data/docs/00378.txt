DURING
A

PROGRAMME
FOR
THE
DETECTION
OF
CF
USING
THE
MECONIUM
ALBUMIN
TECHNIQUE
THE
OVERALL
FALSEPOSITIVE
RATE
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
APPROXIMATELY
1
WHEN
THE
GESTATIONAL
AGE
OF
THE
INFANTS
WAS
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
FALSEPOSITIVE
RATE
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
SIGNIFICANTLY
HIGHER
IN
PRETERM
8
AS
COMPARED
TO
TERM
INFANTS
055
THIS
WAS
DUE
LARGELY
BUT
NOT
SOLELY
TO
THE
PRESENCE
OF
OCCULT

POSSIBLE
EXPLANATIONS
FOR
THESE
FINDINGS
ARE
DISCUSSED
AND
ATTENTION
DRAWN
TO
THE
