THEIR
DIAGNOSIS
OF

THE
ACTIVITY
OF
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
IN

IS
A
COMPOSITE

BOTH
ACIDIC
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
WHICH
HAS
A
PH

ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
WHICH
HAS
A
PH
OPTIMUM
OF

60
WILL
CONTRIBUTE
TO
THE
ACTIVITY
MEASURED
AT
PH

THESE
TWO
FORMS
OF
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
ARE
STRUCTURALLY
AND
GENETICALLY
DISTINCT
AND
HAVE
DIFFERENT
KINETICS
AND
THERMOSTABILITIES
THEREFORE
THE
TOTAL
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
ACTIVITY
AT
PH
54
AND
THE
PHYSICOCHEMICAL
PROPERTIES
OF
THIS

WILL
DEPEND
UPON
THE
RELATIVE
PROPORTIONS
OF
THE

ESPECIALLY
IN

FROM
CHILDREN
ALTHOUGH
THE
DATA
OF
HOSLI
AND
VOGT
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
TOTAL
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
AT
PH
54
DOES
NOT
DIFFER
SIGNIFICANTLY
BETWEEN
CONTROLS
CF
HETEROZYGOTES
AND
CF
HOMOZYGOTES
THEY
DO
NOT
SHOW
WHETHER
THE
PROPORTIONS
OF
ACIDIC

INTERMEDIATE
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
HAVE
CHANGED
AN
INCREASE
IN
THE
PROPORTION
OF
THE
THERMOLABILE
INTERMEDIATE
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
IN
CF
WOULD
BE
MANIFESTED
AS
A
DECREASED
THERMOSTABILITY
OF
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
AT
PH
54
ALTERNATIVELY
A
MUTATION
IN
THE
NORMALLY
STABLE
ACIDIC
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
LEADING
TO
A
LESS
STABLE
FORM
WOULD
ALSO
BE
REFLECTED
AS
A
DECREASED
STABILITY
IN
THE
ACTIVITY
AT
PH
54
ESPECIALLY
IF
THE
PROPORTION
OF
ACIDIC
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
WAS
INCREASED
