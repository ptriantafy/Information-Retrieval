TWO

TWO
STANDARD

HAVE
BEEN
PREPARED
ON
THE

OF
THE

AND
THE

THE

THESE

THE
CALENDAR
YEAR
STUDIES
INDICATE
AN
IMPROVEMENT
TREND
IN
THE
SURVIVAL
EXPERIENCE
FROM
1966
TO
1972
BUT
A
CHANGE
MAY
BE
OCCURRING
THE
STUDY
BY
SEX
EXHIBITS
A
HIGHER
FEMALE
MORTALITY
THE
7

PATIENTS
WHO
HAVE
MECONIUM
ILEUS
AT
BIRTH
SHOW
A
SIGNIFICANTLY
HIGHER
FIRSTYEAR
MORTALITY
AND
A
SOMEWHAT
LOWER
SURVIVAL
RATE
THEREAFTER
EVEN
IF
THE
FIRST

IS
EXCLUDED

DATA
FOR
GROUPS
SPECIFIED
BY
AGE
AT
DIAGNOSIS
ARE
GIVEN
FOR
PATIENTS
DIAGNOSED
DURING
19661972
THERE
IS
SOME
INDICATION
OF
BETTER
SURVIVAL
THAN
FOR
PATIENTS
DIAGNOSED
PRIOR
TO
1966
THE
CONTINUATION
OF
THESE

AN
