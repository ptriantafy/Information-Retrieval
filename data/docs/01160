I
RECENTLY
ONE
OF
US
SUGGESTED
A
NEW
HYPOTHESIS
CONCERNING
THE
BASIC
DEFECT
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
IS
TO
REVIEW
THIS
MODEL
AND
TO
CRITICALLY
DISCUSS
ITS
EVENTUAL
DIAGNOSTIC
APPLICATIONS
WITH
EXTENSIVE
STUDIES
WE
COLLECTED
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
WHICH
CONTRIBUTE
FIVE
MAJOR
ARGUMENTS
IN
FAVOUR
OF
THE
PROPOSITION
THAT

BE
