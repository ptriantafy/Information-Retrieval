FIBROSIS
I
READ
THE
ARTICLE
BY
DRS
ROBINSON
AND
NORMAN
ON
LIFE
TABLES
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WITH
MUCH
INTEREST
THEY
EXPRESS
THEIR
DISAPPOINTMENT
AT
NOT
FINDING
ANY
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
LIFE
EXPECTANCY
OF
CHILDREN
PRESENTING
DURING
THE
FIRST
YEAR
AND
THAT
OF
ALL
CASES
IN
FACT
THE
FORMER
MAY
BE
A
LITTLE
WORSE
IS
IT
NOT
WHAT
SHOULD
BE
EXPECTED
SINCE
INFECTION
IS
KNOWN
TO
BE
PRESENT
AS
EARLY
AS
THE
FIRST
MONTH
OF
LIFE
THE
DIAGNOSIS
IS
PROBABLY
LATE
IN
NEARLY
ALL
CASES
DO
THE
AUTHORS
NOT
POINT
OUT
THE
NECESSITY
OF
AN
EVALUATION
OF
NEONATAL
SCREENING
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
AND
LOGICALLY
ONE
CAN
EXPECT
THAT
A
VERY
LATE
DIAGNOSIS
IS
CONSISTENT
NOWADAYS
WITH
A
VERY
MILD
CASE

AND
THE
BEST
THERAPEUTIC
RESULTS
SHWACHMANS
REPORT
OF
PATIENTS
OVER
17
YEARS
OF
AGE
SEEMS
TO
SUPPORT
THIS
BELIEF
ONLY
12
OF
THE
SERIES
HAD
BEEN
DIAGNOSED
BEFORE
ONE
YEAR
OF
AGE
THEREFORE
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
EVALUATE
THE
COURSE
OF
LATE
PRESENTING
CASES
AFTER
ONE
YEAR
OF
AGE
FOR
INSTANCE
SEPARATELY
SINCE
A
LARGE
DELAY
IN
DIAGNOSIS
MAY
BE
A
CLUE
TO
THE
MILDNESS
OF
THE
DISEASE
