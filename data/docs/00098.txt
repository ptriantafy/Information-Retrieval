IDIOPATHIC
HYPOPROTEINEMIA
IN
TWINS
SINCE
THE
REPORT
OF
AN
EDEMAANEMIAHYPOPROTEINEMIA
SYMPTOM
COMPLEX
IN
INFANTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
SEVERAL
ARTICLES
HAVE
BEEN
PUBLISHED
WE
HAVE
ALSO
PARTICIPATED
IN
THE
CARE
OF
IDENTICAL
MALE
TWINS
WITH
THIS
INTERESTING
SYMPTOM
COMPLEX
THESE
TWINS
OFFER
TWO
MORE
EXAMPLES
OF
THE
EDEMAANEMIAHYPOPROTEINEMIA
SYMPTOM
COMPLEX
OF
INFANT
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
TRANSSUPPLEMENTATION
AND
THE
ABSENCE
OF
HEMOLYSIS
THE
NORMAL
SERUM
IRON
AND
INCREASED
PERIPHERAL
AND
MARROW
IRON
VALUES
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
ANEMIA
RESULTS
FROM
A
DEFECT
AT
THE
LEVEL
OF
HEMOGLOBIN
SYNTHESIS
AND
THAT
IRON
TRANSPORT
REMAINS
SUFFICIENT
IN
THE
FACE
OF
PROTEIN
DEPLETION
POSSIBLY
A
RELATIVE
IRON
DEFICIENCY
OCCURS
AFTER
INCREASED
NUTRITIONAL
INTAKE
DUE
TO
INCREASED
UTILIZATION
LEE
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
HYPOPROTEINEMIA
IS
DUE
TO
LOSS
OF
PROTEIN
IN
STOOLS
BUT
THESE
TWINS
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
LIES
NOT
WITH
LOSSES
THROUGH
URINE
OR
STOOL
BUT
RATHER
WITH
FAILURE
IN
PROTEIN
SYNTHESIS
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
HYPOPROTEINEMIA
SECONDARY
TO
LIVER
DYSFUNCTION
IS
ATTRACTIVE
ALTHOUGH
ALL
LIVER
FUNCTION
TESTS
AND
BIOPSY
FINDINGS
WERE
NORMAL
THIS
IS
OFTEN
THE
CASE
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
ANEMIA
IS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
INCREASED
SERUM
AND
MARROW
IRON
VALUES
AND
IS
MOST
LIKELY
DUE
TO
A
DECREASE
IN
HEMOGLOBIN
SYNTHESIS
ROUTINE
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THERAPY
APPEARS
TO
BE
SUFFICIENT
FOR
CLINICAL
RECOVERY
FOR
ALL
COMPONENTS
OF
THE
SYMPTOM
COMPLEX
