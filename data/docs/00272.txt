WHO
HAVE
HAD
AN
EPISODE
OF
MALNUTRITION
DURING
INFANCY
IN
THIS
STUDY
WE
HAVE
COMPARED
TWO
GROUPS
OF
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ONE
GROUP
OF
CF
CHILDREN
HAD
SEVERE
MALNUTRITION
IN
THE
FIRST
YEAR
OF
LIFE
WHEREAS
THE
SECOND
GROUP
OF
CF
CHILDREN
HAD
NOT
BEEN
MALNOURISHED
THE
CATCHUP
GROWTH
EXPERIENCED
BY
BOTH
THE
CONTROL
AND
MALNOURISHED
GROUPS
WAS
IMPRESSIVE
AND
WAS
GENERALLY
COMPLETE
IN
TERMS
OF
HEIGHT
AND
WEIGHT
FOR
AGE
THIS
FINDING
IS
CONSISTENT

SCORES
THE
DIFFERENCES
WERE
NOT
STATISTICALLY
SIGNIFICANT
EXCEPT
FOR
