FIBROBLASTS
DERIVED
FROM
INDIVIDUALS
WITH

WERE
SHOWN
PREVIOUSLY
TO

SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE
RESISTANT
TO

OF

CYSTIC

FIBROBLASTS
ARE
ALSO
SHOWN
TO

RESISTANT

BETAESTRADIOL
DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE
AND
PROGESTERONE
SINCE
CELLS
ARE
BELIEVED
TO
CONTAIN
DIFFERENT
RECEPTORS
FOR
EACH
OF
THE
STEROID
HORMONES
IT
IS
NOT
PROBABLE
THAN
THE
RESISTANCE
OF

CELLS
TO
THESE
HORMONES
RESULTS
FROM
A
RECEPTOR
DEFICIENCY
THIS
WAS
SHOWN
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
CF
CELLS
WERE
FOUND
TO
EXHIBIT
THE
SAME
RECEPTOR
ACTIVITY
AS
NORMAL
CELLS
FOR
3HDEXAMETHASONE
FURTHERMORE
NEITHER
NORMAL
HUMAN
NOR
CF
FIBROBLASTS
COULD
BE
DEMONSTRATED
TO
CONTAIN
DETECTABLE

IN
ADDITION
THE
STUDIES
OF
FIBROBLAST
KILLING
BY

LED
TO
THE
FURTHER
INTERESTING
OBSERVATION
THAT
NORMAL
HUMAN
DIPLOID
FIBROBLASTS
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
SEX
OF
THE
TISSUE
DONOR
ARE
SENSITIVE
TO
KILLING
BY
EACH
OF
THE

THESE
FINDINGS
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
CYTOTOXIC
EFFECTS
OF
THE
STEROID
HORMONES
MAY
BE
OBSERVED
INDEPENDENTLY
OF
THE
SPECIFIC
HORMONE

THE
STUDIES
REPORTED
HERE
THUS
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
RESISTANCE
OF
CF
CELLS
TO
THE
DIFFERENT
STEROID
HORMONES
IS
PROBABLY
THE
RESULT
