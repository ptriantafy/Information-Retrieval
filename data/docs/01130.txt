FOR
SEVERAL
REASONS
THE
SUPERNATANT
FRACTION
OF
AMNIOTIC
FLUID
IS
NOT
OFTEN
USED
IN
THE
PRENATAL
DETECTION
OF

METABOLISM
IN

THE
BULK
OF
THE
PROTEIN
IN
AMNIOTIC
FLUID
IS
DERIVED
FROM
THE
MATERNAL
CIRCULATION
AND
THIS
CAN
OBSCURE
THE
MORE
CRITICAL
CONTRIBUTION
FROM
THE
