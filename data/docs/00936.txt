IGG
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IT
HAS
BEEN
OBSERVED
THAT
MOST
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
PATIENTS
LACK
AN
ALPHA2
MACROGLOBULINPROTEASE
COMPLEX
AND
THAT
BINDING
OF
TRYPSIN
AND
OTHER
PROTEASES
TO
ALPHA2
MACROGLOBULIN
IS
LOWER
IN
PLASMA
OF
CF
PATIENTS
THAN
IN
THAT
OF
NORMAL
CONTROLS
WE
THEREFORE
DECIDED
TO
STUDY
THE
INTERACTION
OF
TRYPSIN
WITH
PLASMA
PROTEINS
OF
CF
PATIENTS
HERE
WE
REPORT
THAT
TRYPSINBINDING
IGG
TBIGG
IS
PRESENT
IN
80
OF
CF
PATIENTS
AND
IN
30
OF
THEIR
MOTHERS
BUT
NOT
IN
97
OF
NORMAL
CONTROLS
OR
IN
OTHER
RELATIVES
OF
CF
PATIENTS
EXPERIMENTAL
EVIDENCE
SUPPORTS
THE
ANTIBODY
NATURE
OF
TBIGG
WHICH
IS
PRESUMABLY
PRODUCED
AGAINST
THE
PORCINE
TRYPSIN
INGESTED
BY
CF
PATIENTS
AS
PANCREATIC
EXTRACTS
FOR
SUBSTITUTIVE
