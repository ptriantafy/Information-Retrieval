LETTER
FOR
SOME
TIME
NOW
WE
HAVE
BEEN
USING
A
SCREENING
TEST
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
BASED
ON
LEVELS
OF
STOOL
TRYPSIN
AND
CHYMOTRYPSIN
ON
THE
FOURTH
DAY
OF
LIFE
ONE
INTERESTING
OBSERVATION
IS
THE
NUMBER
OF
PREMATURE
BABIES
WHO
HAVE
LITTLE
OR
NO
PANCREATIC
TRYPSIN
OR
CHYMOTRYPSIN
AT
THIS
TIME
FOR
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
BABIES
TESTED
FROM
ST
HELENS

HOSPITAL
BETWEEN
JUNE
1974
AND
APRIL
1975

CLASSIFIED
AS

IN
THE

WERE
RECEIVED
FOR
ONLY
65

COMPARED
WITH
ONLY
25
OF
THE
OTHER

TESTED
DURING
THIS
PERIOD
AS
MAY
BE
EXPECTED
THE
LOWERBIRTHWEIGHT
BABIES
TEND
TO
HAVE
LOWER
STOOLENZYME
CONCENTRATIONS
WE
FEEL
THAT
OUR
DATA
INDICATE
THAT
AT

SOME
PREMATURE

WOULD
BENEFIT
FROM
