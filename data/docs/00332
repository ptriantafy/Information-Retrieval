EMOTIONAL
PROBLEMS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
EMOTIONAL
DISTRESS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
CONSIDERABLE
FROM
THE
MOMENT
OF
DIAGNOSIS
DELAYED
OR
NOT
THE
PARENTS
PROBLEMS
MULTIPLY
AND
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THESE
PROBLEMS
ARE
AT
FIRST
ONLY
VAGUELY
COMPREHENDED
MANY
PARENTS
EMBARK
ON
THE
LONG
HAUL
OF
CARING
FOR
THEIR
CHILD
IN
ALMOST
TOTAL
IGNORANCE
OF
THE
DISEASE
AND
ITS
IMPLICATIONS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
DISEASE
IS
INHERITED
IS
OF
OUTSTANDING
IMPORTANCE
TO
THE
PARENTS
THE
BASIS
OF
GENETIC
COUNSELING
IN
THE
DISEASE
IS
THE
EXPLANATION
OF
RECESSIVE
INHERITANCE
EVEN
WHEN
GENETIC
COUNSELING
HAS
BEEN
GIVEN
EFFECTIVELY
AND
THE
PARENTS
HAVE
DECIDED
TO
HAVE
NO
FURTHER
CHILDREN
THE
FAMILY
PLANNING
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
YET
SOLVED
THE
PHYSIOTHERAPIST
IS
ALSO
NECESSARILY
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
EMOTIONAL
STATE
AND
BEHAVIOUR
OF
THE
CHILD
EXCEPT
IN
THE
LATEST
STAGES
OF
THIS
DISEASE
THE
CHILDS
EMOTIONAL
DISTRESS
IS
NOT
DIRECTLY
RELATED
TO
THE
DISCOMFORT
OF
HIS
SYMPTOMS
OVERPROTECTION
BY
PARENTS
IS
UNDERSTANDABLE
BUT
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
PERSUADE
THEM
THAT
IT
IS
UNDESIRABLE
PERHAPS
THE
MOST
DIFFICULT
QUESTIONS
OF
PROTECTION
ARISE
IN
RELATION
TO
THE
CHILDS
KNOWLEDGE
OF
HIS
OWN
DISORDER
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IS
A
MISERABLE
DISEASE
AND
THE
CAUSE
OF
MUCH
DISTRESS
EMOTIONAL
AND
OTHERWISE
