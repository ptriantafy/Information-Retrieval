THE
PATHOLOGY
OF
INFERTILITY
IN
MOST
SERIES
OF
INFERTILITY
PATIENTS
APPROXIMATELY
40
TO
60
PERCENT
HAVE
NO
DISCERNIBLE
CAUSE
FOR
INFERTILITY
NO
WONDER
THAT
THOSE
WORKING
WITH
THIS
CONDITION
TEND
TO
SEIZE
UPON
ANY
DEMONSTRABLE
TISSUE
ABNORMALITY
AS
RELATED
TO
THE
INFERTILITY
THE
USE
OF
FALLIBLE
DIAGNOSTIC
TOOLS
MAY
LEAD
TO
MISDIAGNOSIS
AND
INAPPROPRIATE
TREATMENT
IN
STUDIES
OF
THE
ACCURACY
OF
DYE
INJECTIONS
TO
DEMONSTRATE
TUBAL
PATENCY
BY
ROENTGENOGRAM
THE
LARGE
ERRORS
INTRODUCED
BY
THESE
METHODS
WERE
EMPHASIZED
BETWEEN
30
TO
40
PERCENT
OF
TUBES
FOUND
BLOCKED
BY
USING
A
SINGLE
DYE
EXAMINATION
AND
USING
THE
CRITERION
OF
FILLING
BUT
NOT
SPILLING
INTO
THE
PERITONEAL
CAVITY
OR
WITH
APPARENT
OBSTRUCTION
AT
THE
UTEROTUBAL
JUNCTION
WERE
SUBSEQUENTLY
FOUND
TO
BE
PATENT
SIMILAR
DATA
WERE
OFFERED
BY
OTHERS
LESIONS
WITH
LESS
OBVIOUS
AND
DEMONSTRABLE
CAUSAL
RELATIONSHIP
TO
INFERTILITY
SUCH
AS
PELVIC
ADHESIONS
AND
ENDOMETRIOSIS
ARE
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
JUDGE
AS
TO
THEIR
ETIOLOGIC
RELATION
THESE
ARE
ASSESSED
IN
DISCUSSIONS
OF
MALE
AND
FEMALE
INFERTILITY
