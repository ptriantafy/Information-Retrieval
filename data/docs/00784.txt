HYPERGAMMAGLOBULINEMIC
PURPURA
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
FOUR
PATIENTS
ARE
PRESENTED
AGED
14
TO
20
YEARS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
RECURRENT
PURPURA
OF
THE
LEGS
THEY
HAVE
POLYCLONAL
INCREASE
OF
IG
BUT
NO
INTERMEDIATE
COMPLEXES
DEMONSTRABLE
BY
ULTRACENTRIFUGATION
THE
4
PATIENTS
DIFFER
FROM
OTHER
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
BY
A
RAPID
DETERIORATION
OF
THE
CLINICAL
CONDITION
AFTER
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
PERMANENT
PULMONARY
INFECTION
AND
ALSO
BY
THEIR
PRONENESS
TO
HAEMOPHILUS
INFLUENZAE
INFECTIONS
THE
CLINICAL
AND
LABORATORY
FINDINGS
ARE
COMPATIBLE
WITH
THE
DIAGNOSIS
OF
WALDENSTROMS
HYPERGAMMAGLOBULINEMIC
PURPURA
THE
HETEROGENEITY
OF
THIS
SYNDROME
IS
DISCUSSED
