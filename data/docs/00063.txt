ALTERATIONS
OF
THE

PROTEIN
FRACTIONS
WERE
FOUND
SOME
OF
WHICH
WERE
SIGNIFICANTLY
CORRELATED
WITH
THE
CLINICAL

THE
SERUM
PROTEINS
AND
ELECTROPHORETIC
PATTERNS
IF
95
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
WERE
FOLLOWED
FOR
1
TO
6
YEARS
IN
EACH
PATIENT
FOR
CF
PATIENTS
AS
A
WHOLE
TOTAL
SERUM
PROTEIN
WAS
UNCHANGED
WHEREAS
ALBUMIN
AND
ALBUMINGLOBULIN
RATIO
WERE
DECREASED

ALL
GLOBULIN
FRACTIONS
INCREASED
TOTAL
SERUM
PROTEIN
WAS
INCREASED
IN

SEVERE
PULMONARY
DISEASE
THE
CHANGES
IN
TOTAL
SERUM
PROTEIN
AND
IN
ALL
PROTEIN
FRACTIONS
WERE
SIGNIFICANTLY
CORRELATED
WITH
CLINICAL

SEVERITY
OF
THE
LUNG
DISEASE
ALL
TERMINAL
PATIENTS
HAD
SEVERE
CHANGES
PATIENTS
WITH
COMPLICATING
LIVER
CIRRHOSIS
HAD
ELECTROPHORETIC
PATTERNS
THAT
DID
NOT
DIFFER
FROM
THOSE
OF
OTHER
CF
PATIENTS
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
MAIN
CAUSE
FOR
SERUM
PROTEIN
ALTERATIONS
IN
CF
IS
THE
LUNG
AFFECTION
WHEREAS
LIVER
INVOLVEMENT
AND
MALABSORPTION
PROBABLY
ARE
OF
MUCH
LESS
IMPORTANCE
