THIS
STUDY
WAS
PERFORMED
TO
DETERMINE
IF
DEFECTIVE
ACTIVATION
OF
C3
TO
C9
BY
BACTERIA
CONTRIBUTES
TO
THE
PATHOGENESIS
OF
THE
RECURRENT
PULMONARY
INFECTIONS
IN
CYSTIC

EACH
OF
THE
BACTERIA
WAS
INCUBATED
IN
THE
SERUM
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
FOR
30
MINUTES
THE
CONSUMPTION
OF
AVAILABLE
C3
WAS
THE

AS
IN
THE

OF
THE

BASED
ON
THE

IT
IS
UNLIKELY
THAT
DEFECTIVE
ACTIVATION
OF
C3

CONTRIBUTES
