EXAMINED
HISTOLOGICALLY

WERE
USED
FOR
MEASUREMENT
OF

ACTIVITIES
THIS
WORK
WAS
UNDERTAKEN
BECAUSE
ENTEROKINASE
IS
CONSIDERED
A
BRUSH
BORDER
ENZYME
THE
RELEASE
OF
WHICH
INTO
THE
INTESTINAL
LUMEN
IS
INFLUENCED
BY
PANCREATIC
ENZYMES
AND
ALSO
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
RECENTLY
SHOWN
A

IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE

PLAY
A
LARGE
ROLE
IN
THE
TURNOVER
OF

AND
THAT
THE
OBSERVED
INCREASE
OF
MUCOSAL

IS
PROBABLY
EXPLAINED
BY
