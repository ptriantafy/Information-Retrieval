THE

OF
THE

IN
THIS

THAT
WERE

THE
STUDY
OF
FIBROBLASTS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
HAS
GIVEN
IMPORTANT
INFORMATION
THE
EVIDENCE
AT
PRESENT
INDICATES
THAT
LYSOSOMES
AND
PROBABLY
OTHER
INTRACELLULAR
ORGANELLES
ARE
NORMAL

SEVERAL

THE

ARE
SERIOUS
THE

USED
TO
DELINEATE
THESE
ABNORMALITIES
ARE
OFTEN
NOT
UNIVERSALLY
REPRODUCIBLE
SOME
BECAUSE
