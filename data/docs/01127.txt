REPORTED
THAT
DIFFERENTIAL

AND
PATIENTS
WE
HAVE
REPEATED
THESE
EXPERIMENTS
PAYING
SPECIAL
ATTENTION
TO
THE
TECHNICAL
DETAILS
GIVEN
IN
THE
HOSLISS
PAPER
IN
A
SEPARATE
SERIES
OF
EXPERIMENTS
WE
USED
LARGER
VOLUMES
OF
PLASMA
FOR
EACH
ASSAY
WHICH
WAS
PERFORMED
EITHER
WITH
OR
WITHOUT
NONFLUORESCENT
PARAFFIN
OIL
IN
BOTH
CASES
THE
BLOOD
SAMPLES
WERE
PROCESSED
EXACTLY
AS
OUTLINED
IN
HOSLI
AND
VOGTS
PAPER
THERE
WERE
NO
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES
IN
THE
HEAT
STABILITY
OF
PLASMA
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
AND
ACID
PHOSPHATASE
