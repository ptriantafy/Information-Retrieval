THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
COMMUNICATION
IS
TO
DISCUSS
HOW
THE
APPLICATION
OF
ONE
METHODOLOGY

THE
STUDY
OF
THE
CULTURED
HUMAN
CELL

HAS
ADDED
INSIGHT
INTO
UNDERSTANDING
THE
GENETIC
REASONS
FOR
SUCH
DISPARATE
CLINICAL
PHENOTYPES
A
MUTANT
GENOTYPE
NOT
RECOGNIZABLE
ANDOR
UNDERSTANDABLE
IN
VIVO
CAN
OFTEN
BE
RECOGNIZED
IN
VITRO
BY
STUDYING
THE
METABOLISM
AND
MORPHOLOGICAL
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
THE
CULTURED
CELL
TWO
SYNDROMES
WILL
BE
USED
AS
ILLUSTRATIONS
OF
THIS
PRINCIPLE

THE
GENETIC
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSES
AND
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
PATIENTS
DESCRIBED
WERE
SELECTED
TO
DEMONSTRATE
HOW
THE
USE
OF
CELL
CULTURE
ADDS
INSIGHT
INTO
THE
DIAGNOSIS
OF
HUMAN
GENETIC
DISORDERS
THE
STUDY
OF
THE
CULTURED
HUMAN
CELL
HAS
AND
WILL
AID
IN
ADVANCING
OUR
ABILITY
TO
DIAGNOSE
HUMAN
GENETIC
DISORDERS
