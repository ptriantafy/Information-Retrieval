LETTER
COMMENT
ON
OUTPATIENT
INTRAVENOUS
THERAPY
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
RECENT
TREND
TO
TREATING
MORE
AND
MORE
PEDIATRIC
PATIENTS
WITH
CHRONIC
DISEASES
ON
AN
AMBULATORY
BASIS
THIS
IS
TRUE
OF
BOTH
HEMOPHILIA
AND
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
DESPITE
THEIR
SUCCESS
IN
KEEPING
SLIGHTLY
MORE
THAN
TWO
THIRDS
OF
THEIR
PATIENTS
OUT
OF
THE
HOSPITAL
I
THINK
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
BE
MORE
SUCCESSFUL
IN
THE
FUTURE
IF
THE
FOLLOWING
POINTS
ARE
CONSIDERED
FIRST
MANY
OF
THOSE
INITIALLY
SELECTED
FOR
INTRAVENOUS
MEDICATIONS
DUE
TO
THEIR
NONRESPONSIVENESS
TO
ORAL
THERAPY
AND
AGAIN
LATER
CONSIDERED
FAILURES
OF
INTRAVENOUS
TREATMENT
MIGHT
ACTUALLY
BE
NONCOMPLIERS
MY
SECOND
POINT
CONCERNS
THE
LACK
OF
FOLLOWUP
WITHIN
THE
PATIENTS
HOME
IT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
ME
THAT
THIS
WOULD
BE
AN
IDEAL
PLACE
FOR
A
PUBLIC
HEALTH
NURSE
TO
CHECK
ON
THE
PATIENTS
CONDITION
ENSURE
THAT
THE
PROCEDURE
WAS
BEING
PROPERLY
FOLLOWED
UNDER
ACTUAL
FIELD
CONDITIONS
AND
THAT
THE
CORRECT
AMOUNT
OF
MEDICINE
HAS
BEEN
UTILIZED

DAVIDS
LETTER
REGARDING
POTENTIAL
PROBLEMS
OF
NONCOMPLIANCE
AND
HOME
FOLLOWUP
IN
THE
USE
OF
OUTPATIENT
INTRAVENOUS
ANTIBIOTICS
POINTS
OUT
THE
NEED
FOR
THIS
TYPE
OF
THERAPY
TO
BE
INSTITUTED
ONLY
IN
THOSE
CENTERS
IN
WHICH
THESE
FACETS
CAN
BE
WELL
CONTROLLED
PUBLIC
HEALTH
NURSES
ARE
UTILIZED
BY
SOME
CENTERS
TO
SUPERVISE
AND
ASSIST
IN
THE
HOME
MANAGEMENT
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WITH
GOOD
SUCCESS
