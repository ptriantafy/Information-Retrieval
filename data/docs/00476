THE
VALUE
OF
SCREENING
IN
PAEDIATRICS
POPULATION
SCREENING
IS
THE
CARRYING
OUT
OF
SOME
TEST
OR
PROCEDURE
ON
EVERY
INDIVIDUAL
WITHIN
A
POPULATION
DEFINED
BY
SUCH
LIMITS
AS
GEOGRAPHY
ADMINISTRATION
RACE
SEX
OR
AGE
AT
RISK
SCREENING
IS
THE
CARRYING
OUT
OF
SUCH
A
TEST
OR
PROCEDURE
ON
A
PERSON
OR
PERSONS
FOR
WHOM
THERE
ALREADY
EXISTS
SOME
MEDICAL
REASON
TO
SUPPOSE
THAT
THE
FINDINGS
MAY
BE
POSITIVE
THIS
REVIEW
OF
CONDITIONS
FOR
WHICH
POPULATION
SCREENING
MAY
BE
CONSIDERED
IS
NOT
EXHAUSTIVE
BUT
IT
SERVES
TO
SHOW
THE
CENTRAL
DILEMMA
IN
THIS
FIELD
WHICH
IS
THAT
APART
FROM
CONGENITAL
DISLOCATION
OF
THE
HIP
PHENYLKETONURIA
AND
POSSIBLY
HOMOCYSTINURIA
NONE
SEEMS
TO
SHOW
QUITE
STRONG
ENOUGH
A
CASE
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
WORTHWHILE
SCREENING
FOR
ON
ITS
OWN
