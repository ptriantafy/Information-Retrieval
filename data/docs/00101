TREATMENT
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THIS
LETTER
IS
PROMPTED
BY
RECENT
REPORTS
OF
FAVOURABLE
RESULTS
AFTER
THE
USE
OF
AN
ARTIFICIAL
DIET
CONSISTING
OF
A
PROTEIN
HYDROLYSATE
A
GLUCOSE
POLYMER
AND
MEDIUMCHAIN
GLYCERIDES
IN
THE
TREATMENT
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
OF
THE
PANCREAS
IT
HAS
BEEN
OUR
OBSERVATION
THAT
CHILDREN
OFTEN
FIND
THESE
PREPARATIONS
UNPLEASANT
AND
UNPALATABLE
LOOSE
MOTIONS
NAUSEA
AND
VOMITING
ARE
QUITE
COMMON
I
HAVE
COMPARABLE
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THEIR
USE
IN
OTHER
MALABSORPTION
STATES
AND
ADVANCED
PROTEINCALORIE
MALNUTRITION
WHETHER
THE
UNTOWARD
EFFECTS
RESULT
FROM
EXCESSIVE
FLOODING
OF
GUT
ANDOR
EXCEEDINGLY
HIGH
BLOODAMINO
ACID
LEVELS
IS
A
MATTER
OF
SPECULATION
