COMMENTS
ON
PUBLICATIONS
CONCERNING
THE
OCCURRENCE
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
IN
BLACK
CHILDREN
HE
FEELS
THAT
CF
OCCURS
MORE
FREQUENTLY
THAN
WE
HAVE
REPORTED
OUR
TENYEAR
SEARCH
IN
THE
WASHINGTON
DC

SHOWS
A
MINIMUM
INCIDENCE
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AMONG
BLACK
NEWBORN
INFANTS
AS
ONE
PER
17000
SINCE
1972
WE
HAVE
IDENTIFIED
AN
ADDITIONAL
FOUR
BLACK
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IN
BLACK
CHILDREN
THIS
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
THE
PREVIOUSLY
REPORTED
INCIDENCE
OF
ONE
IN
17000
THEREFORE
WE
DISAGREE
WITH
HEFFER
THAT
THIS
IS
A
COMMON
DISEASE
AMONG
BLACKS
