ELECTROPHORESIS
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
NOT
SUFFICIENTLY
RELIABLE
TO
DIFFERENTIATE
BETWEEN
NORMAL
AND
CF
MECONIUM
BUT
MARKED
DIFFERENCES
WERE
OBTAINED
WHEN
QUANTITATIVE
IMMUNOELECTROPHORETIC
METHODS
WERE
EMPLOYED
NORMAL
MECONIUM
WAS
SHOWN
TO
CONTAIN
ALPHA1ANTITRYPSIN
AND
ALPHA1ANTICHYMOTRYPSIN
AND
MOST
SAMPLES
CONTAINED
LOW
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
ALBUMIN
AND
MEASURABLE
AMOUNTS
OF
A
VARIETY
OF
OTHER
PLASMA
PROTEINS
IT
IS
SUGGESTED
THAT
QUANTITATIVE
IMMUNOELECTROPHORESIS
COULD
BE
USED
AS
A
MEANS
OF
CONFIRMING
THE
DIAGNOSIS
OF
CF
IF
POSITIVE
RESULTS
ARE
OBTAINED
WHEN
MECONIUM
SPECIMENS
ARE
SCREENED
WITH
TEST
