RECENTLY
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
PLETHORA
OF
RESEARCH
APPROACHES
USING
CELL
CULTURE
TO
STUDY
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
ALTHOUGH
THESE
EFFORTS
CAN
BE
LAUDED

SUCH

BE
RELEVANT
TO
THE

ENTITY
KNOWN
AS
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
ULTIMATE
OBJECTIVES
OF
THIS
RESEARCH
SHOULD
BE
TO
DETERMINE
THE
