REACTIVITY
IN
CHILDREN
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
AND
OTHER
RECURRENT
OR
CHRONIC
BRONCHOPULMONARY
DISEASES
IN
OUR
EFFORTS
TO
STANDARDIZE
THE
EVALUATION
OF
BRONCHIAL
REACTIVITY
WE
PERFORMED
INVESTIGATIONS
INTO
THE
THRESHOLD
DOSAGE
OF
ACETYLCHOLINEINDUCED
BRONCHOSPASM
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
VARIOUS
RECURRENT
AND
CHRONIC
BRONCHOPULMONARY
DISEASES
A
SIGNIFICANTLY
DECREASED
THRESHOLD
VALUE
OF
ACETYLCHOLINE
AND
THUS
AN
INCREASED
BRONCHIAL
REACTIVITY
COULD
BE
PROVEN
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IN
COMPARISON
WITH
HEALTHY
CHILDREN
THE
CAUSE
OF
BRONCHIAL
HYPERREACTIVITY
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CF
MAY
BE
DUE
TO
PROTEASES
DERIVING
FROM
LEUCOCYTES
OF
THE
PURULENT
SPUTUM
FURTHERMORE
WE
INVESTIGATED
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
TERBUTALINE
ON
THE
BRONCHIAL
OBSTRUCTION
INDUCED
BY
ACETYLCHOLINE
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
BRONCHIAL
ASTHMA
AND
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
GROUPS
WERE
COMPARABLE
ESPECIALLY
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
DEGREE
OF
THE
INITIAL
BRONCHIAL
OBSTRUCTION
