FIBROSIS
DECREASED
THERMOSTABILITY
OF
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
IN
CRUDE
EXTRACELLULAR
FLUIDS
OF
PATIENTS
AND
CARRIERS
WE
WISH
TO
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
AN
ABNORMAL
THERMOSTABILITY
HAS
BEEN
FOUND
IN
CRUDE
EXTRACELLULAR
FLUIDS
FOR
ALPHAMANNOSIDASE
MORE
EXTENSIVE
STUDIES
INVOLVING
SEVERAL
OF
THE
LEAKY
HYDROLASES
ARE
UNDER
WAY
AND
THEY
INDICATE
THAT
THE
OBSERVED
THERMOLABILITIES
CAN
BE
EXPLOITED
TO
DEVELOP
THE
URGENTLY
NEEDED
SIMPLE
DIAGNOSTIC
TOOLS
FOR
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
