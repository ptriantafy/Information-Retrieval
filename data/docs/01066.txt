IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THERE
ARE
CERTAIN
ASPECTS
OF
THE
SYMPTOMATOLOGY
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THAT
BEAR
A
RESEMBLANCE
TO
THOSE

WE
FED
A

INTRAVENOUS
ADMINISTRATION
IS
NOT
A

TREATMENT
RESULTS
OF
THE

WERE

ALTHOUGH
SOME

THERE
WERE
NO

NO

OF
EFA
THE
SWEAT
SODIUM
CONCENTRATION
WAS
LOWER
IN

BUT
ONE

THE
CLINICAL
ASPECT
OF
OUR
STUDY
IS
SMALL
BUT
PROMISING
THE
RESULTS
SUGGEST
A
ROLE
FOR
EFAS
IN
THE
CARE
OF
CF
WHETHER
EFA
IS
A
FACTOR
IN
THE
ETIOLOGY
OF
CF
OR
MERELY
A
MANIFESTATION
OF
MALABSORPTION
REQUIRES
FURTHER
INVESTIGATION
