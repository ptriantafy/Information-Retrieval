LETTER
OUR
LABORATORY
HAS
REPORTED
ABNORMAL
POLYAMINE
LEVELS
IN
EXTRACTED
WHOLE
BLOOD
FROM
INDIVIDUALS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
CF
SINCE
AN
ABNORMALITY
IN
PUTRESCINE
UPTAKE
IN
CF
FIBROBLASTS
WOULD
IMPLY
A
DIRECT
RELATIONSHIP
TO
THE
GENETIC
LESION
WE
INITIATED
STUDIES
TO
CONFIRM
AND
POSSIBLE
EXTEND
THIS
OBSERVATION
THERE
IS
NO
SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE
IN
THE
VMAX
OF
CF
FIBROBLASTS
AS
COMPARED
TO
VALUES
OBTAINED
FOR
CONTROL
CELLS
WE
CONCLUDE
THAT
WITH
OUR
GROWTH
AND
ASSAY
CONDITIONS
IN
WHICH
WE
ATTEMPTED
TO
DUPLICATE
THOSE
DESCRIBED
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
INVESTIGATION
THERE
IS
NO
CONSISTENT
OR
SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE
IN
THE
VMAX
OF
PUTRESCINE
UPTAKE
IN
CF
FIBROBLASTS
