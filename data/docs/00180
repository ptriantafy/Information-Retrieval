EFFECTS
OF
MALNUTRITION
ON
THE
MATURING
CENTRAL
NERVOUS
SYSTEM
DURING
RECENT
YEARS
MORE
AND
MORE
DATA
HAVE
BEEN
ACCUMULATED
IMPLICATING
EARLY
MALNUTRITION
IN
SUBSEQUENT
SMALL
STATURE
AND
BEHAVIORAL
ABNORMALITIES
THESE
STUDIES
CAN
BE
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
LARGE
CATEGORIES
ONE
DEALING
WITH
CELLULAR
AND
BIOCHEMICAL
CHANGES
AT
A
TISSUE
LEVEL
AND
ONE
DEALING
WITH
FUNCTIONAL
CHANGES
WITHIN
THE
NERVOUS
SYSTEM
AS
MEASURED
BY
CHANGES
IN
VARIOUS
MODES
OF
BEHAVIOR
THIS
CHAPTER
WILL
ATTEMPT
TO
REVIEW
THE
STUDIES
IN
BOTH
OF
THESE
BROAD
CATEGORIES
WHICH
HAVE
LED
TO
THE
PRESENT
CONCEPT
THAT
MALNUTRITION
DURING
THE
GROWING
PERIOD
WILL
PERMANENTLY
RETARD
GROWTH
RESULTING
IN
A
STUNTED
INDIVIDUAL
AND
MARKEDLY
RETARD
PSYCHOLOGIC
DEVELOPMENT
RESULTING
IN
AN
INDIVIDUAL
WITH
PERMANENTLY
ALTERED
BEHAVIORS
WE
SHALL
FIRST
CONSIDER
THE
NORMAL
CELLULAR
AND
BIOCHEMICAL
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
CENTRAL
NERVOUS
SYSTEM
SECOND
WE
SHALL
EXAMINE
HOW
MALNUTRITION
ALTERS
THESE
CELLULAR
AND
BIOCHEMICAL
PROCESSES
AND
FINALLY
WE
SHALL
REVIEW
THE
EVIDENCE
THAT
IMPLICATES
EARLY
MALNUTRITION
WITH
ALTERATIONS
IN
LATER
BEHAVIOR
AND
ABILITY
TO
LEARN
