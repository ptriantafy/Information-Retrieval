ON
THE
BASIC
DEFECT
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THE
KININ
HYPOTHESIS
IT
IS
OUR
HYPOTHESIS
THAT
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
THERE
IS
A
GENETICALLY
DETERMINED
SPECIFIC
DEFICIENCY
IN
THE
ACTIVITY
OF
EITHER
THE
GLANDULAR
KALLIKREIN
OR
IN
ITS
ACTIVATING
ENZYME
AND
THAT
THIS
DEFECT
IS
THE
PRIMARY
DEFECT
IN
THE
DISEASE
THE
IMMEDIATE
CONSEQUENCE
OF
EITHER
OF
THESE
DEFECTS
IS
THE
ABSENCE
OF
KALLIDIN
AND
THE
RESULTING
FAILURE
OF
REABSORPTION
THE
FACT
THAT
THERE
MAY
BE
MUTATIONS
AFFECTING
DISTINCT
ENZYMES
COULD
ACCOUNT
FOR
THE
GENETIC
HETEROGENEITY
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
A
DEFECTIVE
KALLIKREIN
SYSTEM
WOULD
BE
ACCUMULATION
OF
A
PRECURSOR
RELATED
TO
THE
LOW
MOLECULAR
WEIGHT
KININOGEN
AND
WE
PROPOSE
THAT
THIS
COMPOUND
IS
THE
CILIARYDYSKINESIA
FACTOR
