ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACIDS
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WE
HAVE
READ
WITH
INTEREST
THE
REPORT
BY
ELLIOTT
AND
ROBINSON
CONCERNING
THE
APPARENT
BENEFICIAL
EFFECTS
OF
INTRAVENOUS
FAT
INFUSIONS
IN
A
CHILD
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
WE
QUESTION
WHETHER
THE
INCREASE
IN
ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACIDS
BROUGHT
ABOUT
BY
SOYA
OIL
CAN
ACCOUNT
FOR
THE
FAVOURABLE
COURSE
OF
THE
DISEASE
IN
THIS
PATIENT
OUR
OWN
OBSERVATIONS
CONFIRM
THAT
ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACIDS
LEVELS
ARE
OFTEN
BELOW
NORMAL
IN
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
BUT
THEY
DO
NOT
CORRELATE
WITH
THE
CLINICAL
CONDITION
OF
THE
PATIENT
IT
SEEMS
UNLIKELY
THAT
MINOR
DEGREES
OF
ESSENTIAL
FATTY
ACID
DEFICIENCY
WOULD
IMPAIR
PROSTAGLANDIN
SYNTHESIS
OR
GIVE
RISE
TO
THE
USUAL
CLINICAL
FEATURES
OF
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS

OUR
OWN
MORE
RECENT
RESEARCH
IN
PLATELET
AGGREGATION
PROSTAGLANDIN
AND
CYCLIC
NUCLEOTIDE
PRODUCTION
MAKES
US
AWARE
THAT
SIMPLE
EFA
DEFICIENCY
PER
SE
CANNOT
BE
THE
ORIGIN
OF
THE
SYMPTOMS
OF
CF
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
SOME
OTHER
AGENT
IN
THE
INFUSION
MIXTURE
WHICH
FOR
EXAMPLE
CONTAINS
ABOUT
12
TOCOPHEROL
MAY
BE
A
CONTRIBUTING
FACTOR
IS
ALSO
UNDER
INVESTIGATION
THIS
DOES
NOT
HOWEVER
INVALIDATE
A
POSSIBLE
THERAPEUTIC
EFFECT
OF
EFA
IN
THE
DISEASE
AND
IN
PARTICULAR
A
PARTIAL
CORRELATION
OF
A
POSSIBLE
DISORDER
OF
PROSTAGLANDIN
SYNTHESIS
