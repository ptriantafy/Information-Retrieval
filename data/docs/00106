SULPHATE
INCORPORATION
OF
LEUCOCYTES
FROM
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
IN
PRELIMINARY
STUDIES
OF
SHORTTERM
LEUKOCYTE
CULTURES
USING
NA235SO4
INCORPORATION
INTO
CETYLPYRIDINIUMCHLORIDE
CPCPRECIPITABLE
MATERIAL
PRESUMABLY
GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS
GAG
WE
HAVE
FOUND
SIGNIFICANT
VARIATION
AMONG
CF
PATIENTS
AND
THEIR
PARENTS
OBLIGATE
HETEROZYGOTES
THIS
BIOCHEMICAL
HETEROGENEITY
IS
COMPARABLE
TO
WHAT
HAS
BEEN
REPORTED
IN
FIBROBLAST
CULTURES
AND
SERUM
THE
AMOUNT
OF
NA235SO4
INCORPORATED
INTO
GAG
MATERIAL
FOUND
IN
BOTH
THE
INCUBATION
MEDIUM
AND
THE
CELLS
FROM
CF
PATIENTS
IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
INCREASED
OVER
NORMALS
A
SIMILAR
ANALYSIS
BETWEEN
NORMALS
AND
HETEROZYGOTES
SHOWS
NO
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
IN
NA235SO4
INCORPORATION
INTO
GAG
MATERIAL
OF
THE
CELLS
HOWEVER
4
OUT
OF
6
HETEROZYGOTES
APPEARED
TO
SHOW
A
PATTERN
OF
INCREASED
INCORPORATION
INTO
MATERIAL
FOUND
IN
THE
INCUBATION
MEDIUM
INDICATED
BY
A
HIGHER
MEAN
THAN
THE
NORMAL
DONORS
THESE
RESULTS
SUGGEST
YET
ANOTHER
SYSTEM
TO
STUDY
THE
EFFECTS
OF
THE
CF
GENE
THE
INCORPORATION
OF
NA235SO4
INTO
GAG
MATERIAL
OF
CF
LEUKOCYTE
CULTURES
GIVES
ADDITIONAL
EVIDENCE
FOR
THE
GENETIC
HETEROGENEITY
IN
THIS
DISORDER
