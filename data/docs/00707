OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC

RENINLIKE
ACTIVITY
RLA
WAS
MEASURED
IN
ECCRINE
SWEAT
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
CYSTIC
FIBROSIS
OF
THE
PANCREAS
CF
AND
OF
CONTROLS
SWEATFORMATION
WAS
INDUCED
BY
PILOCARPINEIONTOPHORESIS
OR
BY
LOCAL
INJECTION
OF
CARBAMYLCHOLINE
DORYL
RLAVALUES
BETWEEN
O
NOT
MEASURABLE
AND
460
NGMLH
WERE
MEASURED
WITH
INCREASING
SWEAT
FLOWRATE
A
TENDENCY
TO
LOWER
RLAVALUES
WAS
DETECTED
NO
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
WAS
OBSERVED
BETWEEN
CF
AND
CONTROLS
FROM
THE
OBSERVATION
THAT
RLA
OF
SWEAT
IS
UP
TO
30
TIMES
HIGHER
THAN
THAT
OF
PLASMA
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
RLA
IS
PROBABLY
RELEASED
NOT
FROM
PLASMA
BUT
FROM
THE
SWEAT
GLANDS
THEMSELVES
WHERE
IT
IS
STORED
OR
SYNTHESIZED
